"Peace among worlds <buurrrrppp>", says Rick, fingers in the air, as he stumbles through the town square of the capital of the main world of his car battery's microverse (damn thing won't start again). He is greeted boorishly by Zeep, whom filled with ire, has waited patiently for the day Rick would dare step foot in his home again. "You no longer have power here, asshole!", Zeep shouts. He reaches into his pocket and presses a big red button on a remote, activating a strange dark monolith erected in the center of the square. The world starts to shake violently, tremors becoming more turbulent with each passing moment. Right when it seems all is about to collapse - all becomes still, and all becomes silent. Rick is unphased the whole time, until this very moment - something is different. In a frantic, time slows to a crawl. He reaches for his portal gun as fast as his alcoholic limbs will allow him, but he knows he won't be fast enough, for Zeep and his brethren have already fired all of their guns right at him. He has no choice but to fire the portal gun at himself, from inside of his pocket, knowing that there's a 96% chance that it will kill him. He pulls the trigger just in time, gets hurled through dimensions of time and space, and lands softly on a butt from the butt universe. He should have seen this coming.

When a universe implodes, it shrinks to an infinitisemally small size, and then expands Since there are infinite universes, there is an infinite probability that at least one universe is imploding upon itself at any given moment. Zeep built a device that was able to take the "bubble" surrounding his universe, and switch into the slot of one of the imploding universes ()

Only a universe with a zpolsfhsdf property in its cosmic signature can be switched out from one slot to another.

Zeep's universe had this property, and thus Zeep was able to free his universe from the shackles of being confined to Rick's car battery, and instead into a slot amongst the full universes. 

Luckily, Rick has 329 replacement car batteries. However, he doesn't want the same thing to happen again. How many of his batteries do NOT have the zpolsfhsdf property in their cosmic signatures?

The cosmic signature read-outs show blorg and splin zones. The read-outs are represented by a two-dimensional grid of dashes ("-") for blorg zones and hashtags ("#") for splin zones. A cosmic signature has the zpolsfhsdf property only if there are four or more contiguous splin zones of at least size 5. A zone is contiguous with those directly above, below, to the left, and to the right of it (no diagonals).
