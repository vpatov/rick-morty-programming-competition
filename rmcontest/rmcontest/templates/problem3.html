  Rick and Morty are enjoying one of their occasional inter-galactic cruises, and are figuring out where to go next. They have a long list of galaxies that they are interested in visiting, as well as their coordinates (fortunately all the galaxies they are interested in lie on the same 2-dimensional plane). However, they only have a limited amount of fuel and time, so they decide to only visit <b>two</b> for now. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Not all galaxies are made equal - some just straight up suck and have nothing to offer. So to their list they also add their estimated perceived benefit of visiting. Morty suggests to describe their utility, <b>u</b>, gained from visiting a galaxy X as:
  </p>
 <blockquote><pre><code><div class=code>
	utility(X) = benefit(X) - distance(X)
  </div></code></pre></blockquote>
  <p>
	Rick laughs and says, "&lt;BLECHHH&gt; <b>Morty</b> that's gotta be the <b>dumbest</b> idea you've ever had... <i>Why do you even try</i>? Here.. haha... <b>Here's</b> how we'll figure this out", and pulls out this bad boy:
  </p>
  	<blockquote><pre><code><div class=code>
	utility(X) = benefit(X)**2 - ((distance(X) + 36) // 3)
	# // means integer division
	</div></code></pre></blockquote>
<p>Each galaxy is described as a tuple: (name, coordinates, benefit). </p>
<p>
The adventurers start at coordinates <code>(0,0)</code>. The total utility is found by summing the two utilities for the two galaxies. For example, if the two galaxies they visited were <code>(Alpha, (30,40), 200)</code> and (Bayta, (-10,40), 300), their total utility would be calculated as follows:
</p>
	<blockquote><pre><code><div class=code>
	<u>Alpha</u>
	Distance between (0,0) and (30,40) -> 50 (euclidean distance)
	Benefit -> 200
	Utility -> 200**2 - ((50 + 36) // 3) -> 40000 - 28 -> 39972

	<u>Bayta</u>
	Distance between (30,40) and (-10,40) -> 40
	Benefit -> 300
	Utility -> 300**2 - ((40 + 36) // 3) -> 90000 - 25 -> 89975

	<u>Total Utility</u> -> 39972 + 89975 -> 129947
	</div></code></pre></blockquote>

Here is their list of galaxies:

What is the maximum utility that they can possibly attain according to Rick's formula?
