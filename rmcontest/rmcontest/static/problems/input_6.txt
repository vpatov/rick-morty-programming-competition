the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles
freeman and slave patrician and plebeian lord and serf guildmaster and journeyman in a word oppressor and oppressed stood in constant opposition to one another carried on an uninterrupted now hidden now open fight a fight that each time ended either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large or in the common ruin of the contending classes
in the earlier epochs of history we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of society into various orders a manifold gradation of social rank in ancient rome we have patricians knights plebeians slaves in the middle ages feudal lords vassals guildmasters journeymen apprentices serfs in almost all of these classes again subordinate gradations
the modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms it has but established new classes new conditions of oppression new forms of struggle in place of the old ones
our epoch the epoch of the bourgeoisie possesses however this distinct feature it has simplified class antagonisms society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps into two great classes directly facing each other  bourgeoisie and proletariat
from the serfs of the middle ages sprang the chartered burghers of the earliest towns from these burgesses the first elements of the bourgeoisie were developed
the discovery of america the rounding of the cape opened up fresh ground for the rising bourgeoisie the eastindian and chinese markets the colonisation of america trade with the colonies the increase in the means of exchange and in commodities generally gave to commerce to navigation to industry an impulse never before known and thereby to the revolutionary element in the tottering feudal society a rapid development
the feudal system of industry in which industrial production was monopolised by closed guilds now no longer sufficed for the growing wants of the new markets the manufacturing system took its place the guildmasters were pushed on one side by the manufacturing middle class division of labour between the different corporate guilds vanished in the face of division of labour in each single workshop
meantime the markets kept ever growing the demand ever rising even manufacturer no longer sufficed thereupon steam and machinery revolutionised industrial production the place of manufacture was taken by the giant modern industry the place of the industrial middle class by industrial millionaires the leaders of the whole industrial armies the modern bourgeois
modern industry has established the world market for which the discovery of america paved the way this market has given an immense development to commerce to navigation to communication by land this development has in its turn reacted on the extension of industry and in proportion as industry commerce navigation railways extended in the same proportion the bourgeoisie developed increased its capital and pushed into the background every class handed down from the middle ages
we see therefore how the modern bourgeoisie is itself the product of a long course of development of a series of revolutions in the modes of production and of exchange
each step in the development of the bourgeoisie was accompanied by a corresponding political advance of that class an oppressed class under the sway of the feudal nobility an armed and selfgoverning association in the medieval commune here independent urban republic as in italy and germany there taxable third estate of the monarchy as in france afterwards in the period of manufacturing proper serving either the semifeudal or the absolute monarchy as a counterpoise against the nobility and in fact cornerstone of the great monarchies in general the bourgeoisie has at last since the establishment of modern industry and of the world market conquered for itself in the modern representative state exclusive political sway the executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie
the bourgeoisie historically has played a most revolutionary part
the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his natural superiors and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked selfinterest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom  free trade in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploitation
the bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent awe it has converted the physician the lawyer the priest the poet the man of science into its paid wage labourers
the bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil and has reduced the family relation to a mere money relation
the bourgeoisie has disclosed how it came to pass that the brutal display of vigour in the middle ages which reactionaries so much admire found its fitting complement in the most slothful indolence it has been the first to show what mans activity can bring about it has accomplished wonders far surpassing egyptian pyramids roman aqueducts and gothic cathedrals it has conducted expeditions that put in the shade all former exoduses of nations and crusades
the bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionising the instruments of production and thereby the relations of production and with them the whole relations of society conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form was on the contrary the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes constant revolutionising of production uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones all fixed fastfrozen relations with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions are swept away all newformed ones become antiquated before they can ossify all that is solid melts into air all that is holy is profaned and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life and his relations with his kind
the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the entire surface of the globe it must nestle everywhere settle everywhere establish connexions everywhere
the bourgeoisie has through its exploitation of the world market given a cosmopolitan character to production and consumption in every country to the great chagrin of reactionists it has drawn from under the feet of industry the national ground on which it stood all oldestablished national industries have been destroyed or are daily being destroyed they are dislodged by new industries whose introduction becomes a life and death question for all civilised nations by industries that no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe in place of the old wants satisfied by the production of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes in place of the old local and national seclusion and selfsufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national onesidedness and narrowmindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
the bourgeoisie by the rapid improvement of all instruments of production by the immensely facilitated means of communication draws all even the most barbarian nations into civilisation the cheap prices of commodities are the heavy artillery with which it batters down all chinese walls with which it forces the barbarians intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate it compels all nations on pain of extinction to adopt the bourgeois mode of production it compels them to introduce what it calls civilisation into their midst ie to become bourgeois themselves in one word it creates a world after its own image
the bourgeoisie has subjected the country to the rule of the towns it has created enormous cities has greatly increased the urban population as compared with the rural and has thus rescued a considerable part of the population from the idiocy of rural life just as it has made the country dependent on the towns so it has made barbarian and semibarbarian countries dependent on the civilised ones nations of peasants on nations of bourgeois the east on the west
the bourgeoisie keeps more and more doing away with the scattered state of the population of the means of production and of property it has agglomerated population centralised the means of production and has concentrated property in a few hands the necessary consequence of this was political centralisation independent or but loosely connected provinces with separate interests laws governments and systems of taxation became lumped together into one nation with one government one code of laws one national classinterest one frontier and one customstariff
the bourgeoisie during its rule of scarce one hundred years has created more massive and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding generations together subjection of natures forces to man machinery application of chemistry to industry and agriculture steamnavigation railways electric telegraphs clearing of whole continents for cultivation canalisation of rivers whole populations conjured out of the ground  what earlier century had even a presentiment that such productive forces slumbered in the lap of social labour
we see then the means of production and of exchange on whose foundation the bourgeoisie built itself up were generated in feudal society at a certain stage in the development of these means of production and of exchange the conditions under which feudal society produced and exchanged the feudal organisation of agriculture and manufacturing industry in one word the feudal relations of property became no longer compatible with the already developed productive forces they became so many fetters they had to be burst asunder they were burst asunder
into their place stepped free competition accompanied by a social and political constitution adapted in it and the economic and political sway of the bourgeois class
a similar movement is going on before our own eyes modern bourgeois society with its relations of production of exchange and of property a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange is like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells for many a decade past the history of industry and commerce is but the history of the revolt of modern productive forces against modern conditions of production against the property relations that are the conditions for the existence of the bourgeois and of its rule it is enough to mention the commercial crises that by their periodical return put the existence of the entire bourgeois society on its trial each time more threateningly in these crises a great part not only of the existing products but also of the previously created productive forces are periodically destroyed in these crises there breaks out an epidemic that in all earlier epochs would have seemed an absurdity  the epidemic of overproduction society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism it appears as if a famine a universal war of devastation had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence industry and commerce seem to be destroyed and why because there is too much civilisation too much means of subsistence too much industry too much commerce the productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property on the contrary they have become too powerful for these conditions by which they are fettered and so soon as they overcome these fetters they bring disorder into the whole of bourgeois society endanger the existence of bourgeois property the conditions of bourgeois society are too narrow to comprise the wealth created by them and how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises on the one hand by enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces on the other by the conquest of new markets and by the more thorough exploitation of the old ones that is to say by paving the way for more extensive and more destructive crises and by diminishing the means whereby crises are prevented
the weapons with which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism to the ground are now turned against the bourgeoisie itself
but not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring death to itself it has also called into existence the men who are to wield those weapons  the modern working class  the proletarians
in proportion as the bourgeoisie ie capital is developed in the same proportion is the proletariat the modern working class developed  a class of labourers who live only so long as they find work and who find work only so long as their labour increases capital these labourers who must sell themselves piecemeal are a commodity like every other article of commerce and are consequently exposed to all the vicissitudes of competition to all the fluctuations of the market
owing to the extensive use of machinery and to the division of labour the work of the proletarians has lost all individual character and consequently all charm for the workman he becomes an appendage of the machine and it is only the most simple most monotonous and most easily acquired knack that is required of him hence the cost of production of a workman is restricted almost entirely to the means of subsistence that he requires for maintenance and for the propagation of his race but the price of a commodity and therefore also of labour is equal to its cost of production in proportion therefore as the repulsiveness of the work increases the wage decreases nay more in proportion as the use of machinery and division of labour increases in the same proportion the burden of toil also increases whether by prolongation of the working hours by the increase of the work exacted in a given time or by increased speed of machinery etc
modern industry has converted the little workshop of the patriarchal master into the great factory of the industrial capitalist masses of labourers crowded into the factory are organised like soldiers as privates of the industrial army they are placed under the command of a perfect hierarchy of officers and sergeants not only are they slaves of the bourgeois class and of the bourgeois state they are daily and hourly enslaved by the machine by the overlooker and above all by the individual bourgeois manufacturer himself the more openly this despotism proclaims gain to be its end and aim the more petty the more hateful and the more embittering it is
the less the skill and exertion of strength implied in manual labour in other words the more modern industry becomes developed the more is the labour of men superseded by that of women differences of age and sex have no longer any distinctive social validity for the working class all are instruments of labour more or less expensive to use according to their age and sex
no sooner is the exploitation of the labourer by the manufacturer so far at an end that he receives his wages in cash than he is set upon by the other portions of the bourgeoisie the landlord the shopkeeper the pawnbroker etc
the lower strata of the middle class  the small tradespeople shopkeepers and retired tradesmen generally the handicraftsmen and peasants  all these sink gradually into the proletariat partly because their diminutive capital does not suffice for the scale on which modern industry is carried on and is swamped in the competition with the large capitalists partly because their specialised skill is rendered worthless by new methods of production thus the proletariat is recruited from all classes of the population
the proletariat goes through various stages of development with its birth begins its struggle with the bourgeoisie at first the contest is carried on by individual labourers then by the workpeople of a factory then by the operative of one trade in one locality against the individual bourgeois who directly exploits them they direct their attacks not against the bourgeois conditions of production but against the instruments of production themselves they destroy imported wares that compete with their labour they smash to pieces machinery they set factories ablaze they seek to restore by force the vanished status of the workman of the middle ages
at this stage the labourers still form an incoherent mass scattered over the whole country and broken up by their mutual competition if anywhere they unite to form more compact bodies this is not yet the consequence of their own active union but of the union of the bourgeoisie which class in order to attain its own political ends is compelled to set the whole proletariat in motion and is moreover yet for a time able to do so at this stage therefore the proletarians do not fight their enemies but the enemies of their enemies the remnants of absolute monarchy the landowners the nonindustrial bourgeois the petty bourgeois thus the whole historical movement is concentrated in the hands of the bourgeoisie every victory so obtained is a victory for the bourgeoisie
but with the development of industry the proletariat not only increases in number it becomes concentrated in greater masses its strength grows and it feels that strength more the various interests and conditions of life within the ranks of the proletariat are more and more equalised in proportion as machinery obliterates all distinctions of labour and nearly everywhere reduces wages to the same low level the growing competition among the bourgeois and the resulting commercial crises make the wages of the workers ever more fluctuating the increasing improvement of machinery ever more rapidly developing makes their livelihood more and more precarious the collisions between individual workmen and individual bourgeois take more and more the character of collisions between two classes thereupon the workers begin to form combinations trades unions against the bourgeois they club together in order to keep up the rate of wages they found permanent associations in order to make provision beforehand for these occasional revolts here and there the contest breaks out into riots
now and then the workers are victorious but only for a time the real fruit of their battles lies not in the immediate result but in the ever expanding union of the workers this union is helped on by the improved means of communication that are created by modern industry and that place the workers of different localities in contact with one another it was just this contact that was needed to centralise the numerous local struggles all of the same character into one national struggle between classes but every class struggle is a political struggle and that union to attain which the burghers of the middle ages with their miserable highways required centuries the modern proletarian thanks to railways achieve in a few years
this organisation of the proletarians into a class and consequently into a political party is continually being upset again by the competition between the workers themselves but it ever rises up again stronger firmer mightier it compels legislative recognition of particular interests of the workers by taking advantage of the divisions among the bourgeoisie itself thus the tenhours bill in england was carried
altogether collisions between the classes of the old society further in many ways the course of development of the proletariat the bourgeoisie finds itself involved in a constant battle at first with the aristocracy later on with those portions of the bourgeoisie itself whose interests have become antagonistic to the progress of industry at all time with the bourgeoisie of foreign countries in all these battles it sees itself compelled to appeal to the proletariat to ask for help and thus to drag it into the political arena the bourgeoisie itself therefore supplies the proletariat with its own elements of political and general education in other words it furnishes the proletariat with weapons for fighting the bourgeoisie
further as we have already seen entire sections of the ruling class are by the advance of industry precipitated into the proletariat or are at least threatened in their conditions of existence these also supply the proletariat with fresh elements of enlightenment and progress
finally in times when the class struggle nears the decisive hour the progress of dissolution going on within the ruling class in fact within the whole range of old society assumes such a violent glaring character that a small section of the ruling class cuts itself adrift and joins the revolutionary class the class that holds the future in its hands just as therefore at an earlier period a section of the nobility went over to the bourgeoisie so now a portion of the bourgeoisie goes over to the proletariat and in particular a portion of the bourgeois ideologists who have raised themselves to the level of comprehending theoretically the historical movement as a whole
of all the classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie today the proletariat alone is a really revolutionary class the other classes decay and finally disappear in the face of modern industry the proletariat is its special and essential product
the lower middle class the small manufacturer the shopkeeper the artisan the peasant all these fight against the bourgeoisie to save from extinction their existence as fractions of the middle class they are therefore not revolutionary but conservative nay more they are reactionary for they try to roll back the wheel of history if by chance they are revolutionary they are only so in view of their impending transfer into the proletariat they thus defend not their present but their future interests they desert their own standpoint to place themselves at that of the proletariat
the dangerous class lumpenproletariat the social scum that passively rotting mass thrown off by the lowest layers of the old society may here and there be swept into the movement by a proletarian revolution its conditions of life however prepare it far more for the part of a bribed tool of reactionary intrigue
in the condition of the proletariat those of old society at large are already virtually swamped the proletarian is without property his relation to his wife and children has no longer anything in common with the bourgeois family relations modern industry labour modern subjection to capital the same in england as in france in america as in germany has stripped him of every trace of national character law morality religion are to him so many bourgeois prejudices behind which lurk in ambush just as many bourgeois interests
all the preceding classes that got the upper hand sought to fortify their already acquired status by subjecting society at large to their conditions of appropriation the proletarians cannot become masters of the productive forces of society except by abolishing their own previous mode of appropriation and thereby also every other previous mode of appropriation they have nothing of their own to secure and to fortify their mission is to destroy all previous securities for and insurances of individual property
all previous historical movements were movements of minorities or in the interest of minorities the proletarian movement is the selfconscious independent movement of the immense majority in the interest of the immense majority the proletariat the lowest stratum of our present society cannot stir cannot raise itself up without the whole superincumbent strata of official society being sprung into the air
though not in substance yet in form the struggle of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie is at first a national struggle the proletariat of each country must of course first of all settle matters with its own bourgeoisie
in depicting the most general phases of the development of the proletariat we traced the more or less veiled civil war raging within existing society up to the point where that war breaks out into open revolution and where the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie lays the foundation for the sway of the proletariat
hitherto every form of society has been based as we have already seen on the antagonism of oppressing and oppressed classes but in order to oppress a class certain conditions must be assured to it under which it can at least continue its slavish existence the serf in the period of serfdom raised himself to membership in the commune just as the petty bourgeois under the yoke of the feudal absolutism managed to develop into a bourgeois the modern labourer on the contrary instead of rising with the process of industry sinks deeper and deeper below the conditions of existence of his own class he becomes a pauper and pauperism develops more rapidly than population and wealth and here it becomes evident that the bourgeoisie is unfit any longer to be the ruling class in society and to impose its conditions of existence upon society as an overriding law it is unfit to rule because it is incompetent to assure an existence to its slave within his slavery because it cannot help letting him sink into such a state that it has to feed him instead of being fed by him society can no longer live under this bourgeoisie in other words its existence is no longer compatible with society
the essential conditions for the existence and for the sway of the bourgeois class is the formation and augmentation of capital the condition for capital is wagelabour wagelabour rests exclusively on competition between the labourers the advance of industry whose involuntary promoter is the bourgeoisie replaces the isolation of the labourers due to competition by the revolutionary combination due to association the development of modern industry therefore cuts from under its feet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie produces and appropriates products what the bourgeoisie therefore produces above all are its own gravediggers its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable

-----
in what relation do the communism stand to the proletarians as a whole
the communism do not form a separate party opposed to the other workingclass parties
they have no interests separate and apart from those of the proletariat as a whole
they do not set up any sectarian principles of their own by which to shape and mould the proletarian movement
the communism are distinguished from the other workingclass parties by this only  in the national struggles of the proletarians of the different countries they point out and bring to the front the common interests of the entire proletariat independently of all nationality  in the various stages of development which the struggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie has to pass through they always and everywhere represent the interests of the movement as a whole
the communism therefore are on the one hand practically the most advanced and resolute section of the workingclass parties of every country that section which pushes forward all others on the other hand theoretically they have over the great mass of the proletariat the advantage of clearly understanding the line of march the conditions and the ultimate general results of the proletarian movement
the immediate aim of the communism is the same as that of all other proletarian parties formation of the proletariat into a class overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy conquest of political power by the proletariat
the theoretical conclusions of the communism are in no way based on ideas or principles that have been invented or discovered by this or that wouldbe universal reformer
they merely express in general terms actual relations springing from an existing class struggle from a historical movement going on under our very eyes the abolition of existing property relations is not at all a distinctive feature of communists
all property relations in the past have continually been subject to historical change consequent upon the change in historical conditions
the french revolution for example abolished feudal property in favour of bourgeois property
the distinguishing feature of communists is not the abolition of property generally but the abolition of bourgeois property but modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products that is based on class antagonisms on the exploitation of the many by the few
in this sense the theory of the communism may be summed up in the single sentence abolition of private property
we communism have been reproached with the desire of abolishing the right of personally acquiring property as the fruit of a mans own labour which property is alleged to be the groundwork of all personal freedom activity and independence
hardwon selfacquired selfearned property do you mean the property of petty artisan and of the small peasant a form of property that preceded the bourgeois form there is no need to abolish that the development of industry has to a great extent already destroyed it and is still destroying it daily
or do you mean the modern bourgeois private property
but does wagelabour create any property for the labourer not a bit it creates capital ie that kind of property which exploits wagelabour and which cannot increase except upon condition of begetting a new supply of wagelabour for fresh exploitation property in its present form is based on the antagonism of capital and wage labour let us examine both sides of this antagonism
to be a capitalist is to have not only a purely personal but a social status in production capital is a collective product and only by the united action of many members nay in the last resort only by the united action of all members of society can it be set in motion
capital is therefore not only personal it is a social power
when therefore capital is converted into common property into the property of all members of society personal property is not thereby transformed into social property it is only the social character of the property that is changed it loses its class character
let us now take wagelabour
the average price of wagelabour is the minimum wage ie that quantum of the means of subsistence which is absolutely requisite to keep the labourer in bare existence as a labourer what therefore the wagelabourer appropriates by means of his labour merely suffices to prolong and reproduce a bare existence we by no means intend to abolish this personal appropriation of the products of labour an appropriation that is made for the maintenance and reproduction of human life and that leaves no surplus wherewith to command the labour of others all that we want to do away with is the miserable character of this appropriation under which the labourer lives merely to increase capital and is allowed to live only in so far as the interest of the ruling class requires it
in bourgeois society living labour is but a means to increase accumulated labour in communist society accumulated labour is but a means to widen to enrich to promote the existence of the labourer
in bourgeois society therefore the past dominates the present in communist society the present dominates the past in bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality while the living person is dependent and has no individuality
and the abolition of this state of things is called by the bourgeois abolition of individuality and freedom and rightly so the abolition of bourgeois individuality bourgeois independence and bourgeois freedom is undoubtedly aimed at
by freedom is meant under the present bourgeois conditions of production free trade free selling and buying
but if selling and buying disappears free selling and buying disappears also this talk about free selling and buying and all the other brave words of our bourgeois about freedom in general have a meaning if any only in contrast with restricted selling and buying with the fettered traders of the middle ages but have no meaning when opposed to the communistic abolition of buying and selling of the bourgeois conditions of production and of the bourgeoisie itself
you are horrified at our intending to do away with private property but in your existing society private property is already done away with for ninetenths of the population its existence for the few is solely due to its nonexistence in the hands of those ninetenths you reproach us therefore with intending to do away with a form of property the necessary condition for whose existence is the nonexistence of any property for the immense majority of society
in one word you reproach us with intending to do away with your property precisely so that is just what we intend
from the moment when labour can no longer be converted into capital money or rent into a social power capable of being monopolised ie from the moment when individual property can no longer be transformed into bourgeois property into capital from that moment you say individuality vanishes
you must therefore confess that by individual you mean no other person than the bourgeois than the middleclass owner of property this person must indeed be swept out of the way and made impossible
communists deprives no man of the power to appropriate the products of society all that it does is to deprive him of the power to subjugate the labour of others by means of such appropriations
it has been objected that upon the abolition of private property all work will cease and universal laziness will overtake us
according to this bourgeois society ought long ago to have gone to the dogs through sheer idleness for those of its members who work acquire nothing and those who acquire anything do not work the whole of this objection is but another expression of the tautology that there can no longer be any wagelabour when there is no longer any capital
all objections urged against the communistic mode of producing and appropriating material products have in the same way been urged against the communistic mode of producing and appropriating intellectual products just as to the bourgeois the disappearance of class property is the disappearance of production itself so the disappearance of class culture is to him identical with the disappearance of all culture
that culture the loss of which he laments is for the enormous majority a mere training to act as a machine
but dont wrangle with us so long as you apply to our intended abolition of bourgeois property the standard of your bourgeois notions of freedom culture law c your very ideas are but the outgrowth of the conditions of your bourgeois production and bourgeois property just as your jurisprudence is but the will of your class made into a law for all a will whose essential character and direction are determined by the economical conditions of existence of your class
the selfish misconception that induces you to transform into eternal laws of nature and of reason the social forms springing from your present mode of production and form of property  historical relations that rise and disappear in the progress of production  this misconception you share with every ruling class that has preceded you what you see clearly in the case of ancient property what you admit in the case of feudal property you are of course forbidden to admit in the case of your own bourgeois form of property
abolition aufhebung of the family even the most radical flare up at this infamous proposal of the communism
on what foundation is the present family the bourgeois family based on capital on private gain in its completely developed form this family exists only among the bourgeoisie but this state of things finds its complement in the practical absence of the family among the proletarians and in public prostitution
the bourgeois family will vanish as a matter of course when its complement vanishes and both will vanish with the vanishing of capital
do you charge us with wanting to stop the exploitation of children by their parents to this crime we plead guilty
but you say we destroy the most hallowed of relations when we replace home education by social
and your education is not that also social and determined by the social conditions under which you educate by the intervention direct or indirect of society by means of schools c the communism have not invented the intervention of society in education they do but seek to alter the character of that intervention and to rescue education from the influence of the ruling class
the bourgeois claptrap about the family and education about the hallowed corelation of parents and child becomes all the more disgusting the more by the action of modern industry all the family ties among the proletarians are torn asunder and their children transformed into simple articles of commerce and instruments of labour
but you communism would introduce community of women screams the bourgeoisie in chorus
the bourgeois sees his wife a mere instrument of production he hears that the instruments of production are to be exploited in common and naturally can come to no other conclusion that the lot of being common to all will likewise fall to the women
he has not even a suspicion that the real point aimed at is to do away with the status of women as mere instruments of production
for the rest nothing is more ridiculous than the virtuous indignation of our bourgeois at the community of women which they pretend is to be openly and officially established by the communism the communism have no need to introduce community of women it has existed almost from time immemorial
our bourgeois not content with having wives and daughters of their proletarians at their disposal not to speak of common prostitutes take the greatest pleasure in seducing each others wives
bourgeois marriage is in reality a system of wives in common and thus at the most what the communism might possibly be reproached with is that they desire to introduce in substitution for a hypocritically concealed an openly legalised community of women for the rest it is selfevident that the abolition of the present system of production must bring with it the abolition of the community of women springing from that system ie of prostitution both public and private
the communism are further reproached with desiring to abolish countries and nationality
the working men have no country we cannot take from them what they have not got since the proletariat must first of all acquire political supremacy must rise to be the leading class of the nation must constitute itself the nation it is so far itself national though not in the bourgeois sense of the word
national differences and antagonism between peoples are daily more and more vanishing owing to the development of the bourgeoisie to freedom of commerce to the world market to uniformity in the mode of production and in the conditions of life corresponding thereto
the supremacy of the proletariat will cause them to vanish still faster united action of the leading civilised countries at least is one of the first conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat
in proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another will also be put an end to the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put an end to in proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end
the charges against communists made from a religious a philosophical and generally from an ideological standpoint are not deserving of serious examination
does it require deep intuition to comprehend that mans ideas views and conception in one word mans consciousness changes with every change in the conditions of his material existence in his social relations and in his social life
what else does the history of ideas prove than that intellectual production changes its character in proportion as material production is changed the ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class
when people speak of the ideas that revolutionise society they do but express that fact that within the old society the elements of a new one have been created and that the dissolution of the old ideas keeps even pace with the dissolution of the old conditions of existence
when the ancient world was in its last throes the ancient religions were overcome by christianity when christian ideas succumbed in the th century to rationalist ideas feudal society fought its death battle with the then revolutionary bourgeoisie the ideas of religious liberty and freedom of conscience merely gave expression to the sway of free competition within the domain of knowledge
undoubtedly it will be said religious moral philosophical and juridical ideas have been modified in the course of historical development but religion morality philosophy political science and law constantly survived this change
there are besides eternal truths such as freedom justice etc that are common to all states of society but communists abolishes eternal truths it abolishes all religion and all morality instead of constituting them on a new basis it therefore acts in contradiction to all past historical experience
what does this accusation reduce itself to the history of all past society has consisted in the development of class antagonisms antagonisms that assumed different forms at different epochs
but whatever form they may have taken one fact is common to all past ages viz the exploitation of one part of society by the other no wonder then that the social consciousness of past ages despite all the multiplicity and variety it displays moves within certain common forms or general ideas which cannot completely vanish except with the total disappearance of class antagonisms
the communist revolution is the most radical rupture with traditional property relations no wonder that its development involved the most radical rupture with traditional ideas
but let us have done with the bourgeois objections to communists
we have seen above that the first step in the revolution by the working class is to raise the proletariat to the position of ruling class to win the battle of democracy
the proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest by degree all capital from the bourgeoisie to centralise all instruments of production in the hands of the state ie of the proletariat organised as the ruling class and to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as possible
of course in the beginning this cannot be effected except by means of despotic inroads on the rights of property and on the conditions of bourgeois production by means of measures therefore which appear economically insufficient and untenable but which in the course of the movement outstrip themselves necessitate further inroads upon the old social order and are unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionising the mode of production
these measures will of course be different in different countries
nevertheless in most advanced countries the following will be pretty generally applicable
 abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes 
 a heavy progressive or graduated income tax 
 abolition of all rights of inheritance 
 confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels 
 centralisation of credit in the hands of the state by means of a national bank with state capital and an exclusive monopoly 
 centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the state 
 extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the state the bringing into cultivation of wastelands and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan 
 equal liability of all to work establishment of industrial armies especially for agriculture 
 combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries gradual abolition of all the distinction between town and country by a more equable distribution of the populace over the country 
 free education for all children in public schools abolition of childrens factory labour in its present form combination of education with industrial production c c
when in the course of development class distinctions have disappeared and all production has been concentrated in the hands of a vast association of the whole nation the public power will lose its political character political power properly so called is merely the organised power of one class for oppressing another if the proletariat during its contest with the bourgeoisie is compelled by the force of circumstances to organise itself as a class if by means of a revolution it makes itself the ruling class and as such sweeps away by force the old conditions of production then it will along with these conditions have swept away the conditions for the existence of class antagonisms and of classes generally and will thereby have abolished its own supremacy as a class
in place of the old bourgeois society with its classes and class antagonisms we shall have an association in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all

owing to their historical position it became the vocation of the aristocracies of france and england to write pamphlets against modern bourgeois society in the french revolution of july  and in the english reform agitationa these aristocracies again succumbed to the hateful upstart thenceforth a serious political struggle was altogether out of the question a literary battle alone remained possible but even in the domain of literature the old cries of the restoration period had become impossible
in order to arouse sympathy the aristocracy was obliged to lose sight apparently of its own interests and to formulate their indictment against the bourgeoisie in the interest of the exploited working class alone thus the aristocracy took their revenge by singing lampoons on their new masters and whispering in his ears sinister prophesies of coming catastrophe
in this way arose feudal socialism half lamentation half lampoon half an echo of the past half menace of the future at times by its bitter witty and incisive criticism striking the bourgeoisie to the very hearts core but always ludicrous in its effect through total incapacity to comprehend the march of modern history
the aristocracy in order to rally the people to them waved the proletarian almsbag in front for a banner but the people so often as it joined them saw on their hindquarters the old feudal coats of arms and deserted with loud and irreverent laughter
one section of the french legitimists and young england exhibited this spectacle
in pointing out that their mode of exploitation was different to that of the bourgeoisie the feudalists forget that they exploited under circumstances and conditions that were quite different and that are now antiquated in showing that under their rule the modern proletariat never existed they forget that the modern bourgeoisie is the necessary offspring of their own form of society
for the rest so little do they conceal the reactionary character of their criticism that their chief accusation against the bourgeois amounts to this that under the bourgeois regime a class is being developed which is destined to cut up root and branch the old order of society
what they upbraid the bourgeoisie with is not so much that it creates a proletariat as that it creates a revolutionary proletariat
in political practice therefore they join in all coercive measures against the working class and in ordinary life despite their highfalutin phrases they stoop to pick up the golden apples dropped from the tree of industry and to barter truth love and honour for traffic in wool beetrootsugar and potato spirits
as the parson has ever gone hand in hand with the landlord so has clerical socialism with feudal socialism
nothing is easier than to give christian asceticism a socialist tinge has not christianity declaimed against private property against marriage against the state has it not preached in the place of these charity and poverty celibacy and mortification of the flesh monastic life and mother church christian socialism is but the holy water with which the priest consecrates the heartburnings of the aristocrat
the feudal aristocracy was not the only class that was ruined by the bourgeoisie not the only class whose conditions of existence pined and perished in the atmosphere of modern bourgeois society the medieval burgesses and the small peasant proprietors were the precursors of the modern bourgeoisie in those countries which are but little developed industrially and commercially these two classes still vegetate side by side with the rising bourgeoisie
in countries where modern civilisation has become fully developed a new class of petty bourgeois has been formed fluctuating between proletariat and bourgeoisie and ever renewing itself as a supplementary part of bourgeois society the individual members of this class however are being constantly hurled down into the proletariat by the action of competition and as modern industry develops they even see the moment approaching when they will completely disappear as an independent section of modern society to be replaced in manufactures agriculture and commerce by overlookers bailiffs and shopmen
in countries like france where the peasants constitute far more than half of the population it was natural that writers who sided with the proletariat against the bourgeoisie should use in their criticism of the bourgeois regime the standard of the peasant and petty bourgeois and from the standpoint of these intermediate classes should take up the cudgels for the working class thus arose pettybourgeois socialism sismondi was the head of this school not only in france but also in england
this school of socialism dissected with great acuteness the contradictions in the conditions of modern production it laid bare the hypocritical apologies of economists it proved incontrovertibly the disastrous effects of machinery and division of labour the concentration of capital and land in a few hands overproduction and crises it pointed out the inevitable ruin of the petty bourgeois and peasant the misery of the proletariat the anarchy in production the crying inequalities in the distribution of wealth the industrial war of extermination between nations the dissolution of old moral bonds of the old family relations of the old nationalities
in its positive aims however this form of socialism aspires either to restoring the old means of production and of exchange and with them the old property relations and the old society or to cramping the modern means of production and of exchange within the framework of the old property relations that have been and were bound to be exploded by those means in either case it is both reactionary and utopian
its last words are corporate guilds for manufacture patriarchal relations in agriculture
ultimately when stubborn historical facts had dispersed all intoxicating effects of selfdeception this form of socialism ended in a miserable fit of the blues
the socialist and communist literature of france a literature that originated under the pressure of a bourgeoisie in power and that was the expressions of the struggle against this power was introduced into germany at a time when the bourgeoisie in that country had just begun its contest with feudal absolutism
german philosophers wouldbe philosophers and beaux esprits men of letters eagerly seized on this literature only forgetting that when these writings immigrated from france into germany french social conditions had not immigrated along with them in contact with german social conditions this french literature lost all its immediate practical significance and assumed a purely literary aspect thus to the german philosophers of the eighteenth century the demands of the first french revolution were nothing more than the demands of practical reason in general and the utterance of the will of the revolutionary french bourgeoisie signified in their eyes the laws of pure will of will as it was bound to be of true human will generally
the work of the german literati consisted solely in bringing the new french ideas into harmony with their ancient philosophical conscience or rather in annexing the french ideas without deserting their own philosophic point of view
this annexation took place in the same way in which a foreign language is appropriated namely by translation
it is well known how the monks wrote silly lives of catholic saints over the manuscripts on which the classical works of ancient heathendom had been written the german literati reversed this process with the profane french literature they wrote their philosophical nonsense beneath the french original for instance beneath the french criticism of the economic functions of money they wrote alienation of humanity and beneath the french criticism of the bourgeois state they wrote dethronement of the category of the general and so forth
the introduction of these philosophical phrases at the back of the french historical criticisms they dubbed philosophy of action true socialism german science of socialism philosophical foundation of socialism and so on
the french socialist and communist literature was thus completely emasculated and since it ceased in the hands of the german to express the struggle of one class with the other he felt conscious of having overcome french onesidedness and of representing not true requirements but the requirements of truth not the interests of the proletariat but the interests of human nature of man in general who belongs to no class has no reality who exists only in the misty realm of philosophical fantasy
this german socialism which took its schoolboy task so seriously and solemnly and extolled its poor stockintrade in such a mountebank fashion meanwhile gradually lost its pedantic innocence
the fight of the germans and especially of the prussian bourgeoisie against feudal aristocracy and absolute monarchy in other words the liberal movement became more earnest
by this the longwished for opportunity was offered to true socialism of confronting the political movement with the socialist demands of hurling the traditional anathemas against liberalism against representative government against bourgeois competition bourgeois freedom of the press bourgeois legislation bourgeois liberty and equality and of preaching to the masses that they had nothing to gain and everything to lose by this bourgeois movement german socialism forgot in the nick of time that the french criticism whose silly echo it was presupposed the existence of modern bourgeois society with its corresponding economic conditions of existence and the political constitution adapted thereto the very things those attainment was the object of the pending struggle in germany
to the absolute governments with their following of parsons professors country squires and officials it served as a welcome scarecrow against the threatening bourgeoisie
it was a sweet finish after the bitter pills of flogging and bullets with which these same governments just at that time dosed the german workingclass risings
while this true socialism thus served the government as a weapon for fighting the german bourgeoisie it at the same time directly represented a reactionary interest the interest of german philistines in germany the pettybourgeois class a relic of the sixteenth century and since then constantly cropping up again under the various forms is the real social basis of the existing state of things
to preserve this class is to preserve the existing state of things in germany the industrial and political supremacy of the bourgeoisie threatens it with certain destruction  on the one hand from the concentration of capital on the other from the rise of a revolutionary proletariat true socialism appeared to kill these two birds with one stone it spread like an epidemic
the robe of speculative cobwebs embroidered with flowers of rhetoric steeped in the dew of sickly sentiment this transcendental robe in which the german socialists wrapped their sorry eternal truths all skin and bone served to wonderfully increase the sale of their goods amongst such a public
and on its part german socialism recognised more and more its own calling as the bombastic representative of the pettybourgeois philistine
it proclaimed the german nation to be the model nation and the german petty philistine to be the typical man to every villainous meanness of this model man it gave a hidden higher socialistic interpretation the exact contrary of its real character it went to the extreme length of directly opposing the brutally destructive tendency of communists and of proclaiming its supreme and impartial contempt of all class struggles with very few exceptions all the socalled socialist and communist publications that now  circulate in germany belong to the domain of this foul and enervating literature
conservative or bourgeois socialism
a part of the bourgeoisie is desirous of redressing social grievances in order to secure the continued existence of bourgeois society
to this section belong economists philanthropists humanitarians improvers of the condition of the working class organisers of charity members of societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals temperance fanatics holeandcorner reformers of every imaginable kind this form of socialism has moreover been worked out into complete systems
we may cite proudhons philosophie de la misere as an example of this form
the socialistic bourgeois want all the advantages of modern social conditions without the struggles and dangers necessarily resulting therefrom they desire the existing state of society minus its revolutionary and disintegrating elements they wish for a bourgeoisie without a proletariat the bourgeoisie naturally conceives the world in which it is supreme to be the best and bourgeois socialism develops this comfortable conception into various more or less complete systems in requiring the proletariat to carry out such a system and thereby to march straightway into the social new jerusalem it but requires in reality that the proletariat should remain within the bounds of existing society but should cast away all its hateful ideas concerning the bourgeoisie
a second and more practical but less systematic form of this socialism sought to depreciate every revolutionary movement in the eyes of the working class by showing that no mere political reform but only a change in the material conditions of existence in economical relations could be of any advantage to them by changes in the material conditions of existence this form of socialism however by no means understands abolition of the bourgeois relations of production an abolition that can be affected only by a revolution but administrative reforms based on the continued existence of these relations reforms therefore that in no respect affect the relations between capital and labour but at the best lessen the cost and simplify the administrative work of bourgeois government
bourgeois socialism attains adequate expression when and only when it becomes a mere figure of speech
free trade for the benefit of the working class protective duties for the benefit of the working class prison reform for the benefit of the working class this is the last word and the only seriously meant word of bourgeois socialism
it is summed up in the phrase the bourgeois is a bourgeois  for the benefit of the working class 
criticalutopian socialism and communists
we do not here refer to that literature which in every great modern revolution has always given voice to the demands of the proletariat such as the writings of babeuf and others
the first direct attempts of the proletariat to attain its own ends made in times of universal excitement when feudal society was being overthrown necessarily failed owing to the then undeveloped state of the proletariat as well as to the absence of the economic conditions for its emancipation conditions that had yet to be produced and could be produced by the impending bourgeois epoch alone the revolutionary literature that accompanied these first movements of the proletariat had necessarily a reactionary character it inculcated universal asceticism and social levelling in its crudest form
the socialist and communist systems properly so called those of saintsimon fourier owen and others spring into existence in the early undeveloped period described above of the struggle between proletariat and bourgeoisie see section  bourgeois and proletarians
the founders of these systems see indeed the class antagonisms as well as the action of the decomposing elements in the prevailing form of society but the proletariat as yet in its infancy offers to them the spectacle of a class without any historical initiative or any independent political movement
since the development of class antagonism keeps even pace with the development of industry the economic situation as they find it does not as yet offer to them the material conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat they therefore search after a new social science after new social laws that are to create these conditions
historical action is to yield to their personal inventive action historically created conditions of emancipation to fantastic ones and the gradual spontaneous class organisation of the proletariat to an organisation of society especially contrived by these inventors future history resolves itself in their eyes into the propaganda and the practical carrying out of their social plans
in the formation of their plans they are conscious of caring chiefly for the interests of the working class as being the most suffering class only from the point of view of being the most suffering class does the proletariat exist for them
the undeveloped state of the class struggle as well as their own surroundings causes socialists of this kind to consider themselves far superior to all class antagonisms they want to improve the condition of every member of society even that of the most favoured hence they habitually appeal to society at large without the distinction of class nay by preference to the ruling class for how can people when once they understand their system fail to see in it the best possible plan of the best possible state of society
hence they reject all political and especially all revolutionary action they wish to attain their ends by peaceful means necessarily doomed to failure and by the force of example to pave the way for the new social gospel
such fantastic pictures of future society painted at a time when the proletariat is still in a very undeveloped state and has but a fantastic conception of its own position correspond with the first instinctive yearnings of that class for a general reconstruction of society
but these socialist and communist publications contain also a critical element they attack every principle of existing society hence they are full of the most valuable materials for the enlightenment of the working class the practical measures proposed in them  such as the abolition of the distinction between town and country of the family of the carrying on of industries for the account of private individuals and of the wage system the proclamation of social harmony the conversion of the function of the state into a more superintendence of production  all these proposals point solely to the disappearance of class antagonisms which were at that time only just cropping up and which in these publications are recognised in their earliest indistinct and undefined forms only these proposals therefore are of a purely utopian character
the significance of criticalutopian socialism and communists bears an inverse relation to historical development in proportion as the modern class struggle develops and takes definite shape this fantastic standing apart from the contest these fantastic attacks on it lose all practical value and all theoretical justification therefore although the originators of these systems were in many respects revolutionary their disciples have in every case formed mere reactionary sects they hold fast by the original views of their masters in opposition to the progressive historical development of the proletariat they therefore endeavour and that consistently to deaden the class struggle and to reconcile the class antagonisms they still dream of experimental realisation of their social utopias of founding isolated phalansteres of establishing home colonies or setting up a little icaria  duodecimo editions of the new jerusalem  and to realise all these castles in the air they are compelled to appeal to the feelings and purses of the bourgeois by degrees they sink into the category of the reactionary or conservative socialists depicted above differing from these only by more systematic pedantry and by their fanatical and superstitious belief in the miraculous effects of their social science
they therefore violently oppose all political action on the part of the working class such action according to them can only result from blind unbelief in the new gospel
the owenites in england and the fourierists in france respectively oppose the chartists and the reformistes

-----
section ii has made clear the relations of the communism to the existing workingclass parties such as the chartists in england and the agrarian reformers in america
the communism fight for the attainment of the immediate aims for the enforcement of the momentary interests of the working class but in the movement of the present they also represent and take care of the future of that movement in france the communism ally with the socialdemocrats against the conservative and radical bourgeoisie reserving however the right to take up a critical position in regard to phases and illusions traditionally handed down from the great revolution
in switzerland they support the radicals without losing sight of the fact that this party consists of antagonistic elements partly of democratic socialists in the french sense partly of radical bourgeois
in poland they support the party that insists on an agrarian revolution as the prime condition for national emancipation that party which fomented the insurrection of cracow in 
in germany they fight with the bourgeoisie whenever it acts in a revolutionary way against the absolute monarchy the feudal squirearchy and the petty bourgeoisie
but they never cease for a single instant to instill into the working class the clearest possible recognition of the hostile antagonism between bourgeoisie and proletariat in order that the german workers may straightway use as so many weapons against the bourgeoisie the social and political conditions that the bourgeoisie must necessarily introduce along with its supremacy and in order that after the fall of the reactionary classes in germany the fight against the bourgeoisie itself may immediately begin
the communism turn their attention chiefly to germany because that country is on the eve of a bourgeois revolution that is bound to be carried out under more advanced conditions of european civilisation and with a much more developed proletariat than that of england was in the seventeenth and france in the eighteenth century and because the bourgeois revolution in germany will be but the prelude to an immediately following proletarian revolution
in short the communism everywhere support every revolutionary movement against the existing social and political order of things
in all these movements they bring to the front as the leading question in each the property question no matter what its degree of development at the time
finally they labour everywhere for the union and agreement of the democratic parties of all countries
the communism disdain to conceal their views and aims they openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions let the ruling classes tremble at a communistic revolution the proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains they have a world to win
working men of all countries unite

before advancing to the more exciting field of analyzing
diverse policy schemes from the standpoint of economic
theory and political philosophy it is essential to introduce
and explain the basic concepts used throughout the following
study indeed the concepts explained in this chapterthe
concepts of property contract aggression capitalism and socialismare
so basic so fundamental that one cannot even avoid
making use of them if at times only implicitly unfortunately
though the very fact that in analyzing any kind of human action
andor any kind of interpersonal relationship one must make use
of these concepts does not imply that everyone has a precise understanding
of them it seems instead to be the other way around
because the concept of property for instance is so basic that
everyone seems to have some immediate understanding of it most
people never think about it carefully and can as a consequence
produce at best a very vague definition but starting from imprecisely
stated or assumed definitions and building a complex network
of thought upon them can lead only to intellectual disaster
for the original imprecisions and loopholes will then pervade and
distort everything derived from them to avoid this the concept of
property must first be clarified 
next to the concept of action property is the most basic category
in the social sciences as a matter of fact all other concepts
to be introduced in this chapteraggression contract capitalism
and socialismare definable in terms of property aggression
being aggression against property contract being a nonaggressive
relationship between property owners socialism being an institutionalized
policy of aggression against property and capitalism
being an institutionalized policy of the recognition of property and
contractualism
let us start with an elucidation of the precondition necessary
for the concept of property to emerge
 for a concept of property
to arise there must be a scarcity of goods should there be no scarcity
and should all goods be socalled free goods whose use by
any one person for any one purpose would not in any way exclude
or interfere with or restrict its use by any other person or for any
other purpose then there would be no need for property if let us
say due to some paradisiac superabundance of bananas my present
consumption of bananas does not in any way reduce my own
future supply possible consumption of bananas nor the present
or the future supply of bananas for any other person then the
assignment of property rights here with respect to bananas would
be superfluous to develop the concept of property it is necessary
for goods to be scarce so that conflicts over the use of these goods
can possibly arise it is the function of property rights to avoid
such possible clashes over the use of scarce resources by assigning
rights of exclusive ownership property is thus a normative concept
a concept designed to make a conflictfree interaction possible
by stipulating mutually binding rules of conduct norms
regarding scarce resources
as a matter
of fact even if we were to assume that we lived in the garden
of eden where there was a superabundance of everything needed
not only to sustain ones life but to indulge in every possible comfort
by simply stretching out ones hand the concept of property
would necessarily have to evolve for even under these ideal circumstances
every persons physical body would still be a scarce
resource and thus the need for the establishment of property rules
ie rules regarding peoples bodies would exist one is not used to
thinking of ones own body in terms of a scarce good but in imagining
the most ideal situation one could ever hope for the garden
of eden it becomes possible to realize that ones body is indeed the
prototype of a scarce good for the use of which property rights ie
rights of exclusive ownership somehow have to be established in
order to avoid clashes
as a matter of fact as long as a person acts
 ie as long as a
person intentionally tries to change a state of affairs that is subjectively
perceived and evaluated as less satisfactory into a state that
appears more rewarding this action necessarily involves a choice
regarding the use of this persons body and choosing preferring
one thing or state over another evidently implies that not everything
not all possible pleasures or satisfactions can be had at one
and the same time but rather that something considered less valuable
must be given up in order to attain something else considered to be more valuable thus choosing always implies the incurrence
of costs foregoing possible enjoyments because the means needed
to attain them are scarce and are bound up in some alternative use
which promises returns valued more highly than the opportunities
forfeitedeven in the garden of eden i could not simultaneously
eat an apple smoke a cigarette have a drink climb up a tree read
a book build a house play with my cat drive a car etc i would
have to make choices and could do things only sequentially and
this would be so because there is only one body that i can use to do
these things and enjoy the satisfaction derived from doing them i
do not have a superabundance of bodies which would allow me to
enjoy all possible satisfactions simultaneously in one single bliss
and i would be restrained by scarcity in another respect as well as
long as this scarce resource body is not indestructible and is not
equipped with eternal health and energy but rather is an organism
with only a limited life span time is scarce too the time used up
in pursuing goal a reduces the time left to pursue other goals and
the longer it takes to reach a desired result the higher the costs
involved in waiting will be and the higher the expected satisfaction
must be in order to justify these costs
thus because of the scarcity of body and time even in the
garden of eden property regulations would have to be established
without them and assuming now that more than one person
exists that their range of action overlaps and that there is no preestablished
harmony and synchronization of interests among these
persons conflicts over the use of ones own body would be unavoidable
i might for instance want to use my body to enjoy drinking a
cup of tea while someone else might want to start a love affair with
it thus preventing me from having my tea and also reducing the
time left to pursue my own goals by means of this body

we have defined socialism as an institutionalized policy
of redistribution of property titles more precisely
it is a transfer of property titles from people
who have actually put scarce means to some use or
who have acquired them contractually from persons who have
done so previously onto persons who have neither done anything
with the things in question nor acquired them contractually for a
highly unrealistic worldthe garden of edeni then pointed out
the socioeconomic consequences of such a system of assigning
property rights were then pointed out a reduction of investment in
human capital and increased incentives for the evolution of nonproductive
personality types
i now want to enlarge and concretize this analysis of socialism
and its socioeconomic impact by looking at different though equally
typical versions of socialism in this chapter i will concentrate on the
analysis of what most people have come to view as socialism par
excellence if not the only type of socialism there is this probably
being the most appropriate starting point for any discussion of
socialism this socialism par excellence is a social system in which
the means of production that is the scarce resources used to produce
consumption goods are nationalized or socialized
 a theory of socialism and capitalism
indeed while karl marx and like him most of our contemporary
intellectuals of the left was almost exclusively concerned with
the analysis of the economic and social defects of capitalism and in
all of his writings made only a few general and vague remarks about
the constructive problem of the organization of the process of production
under socialism capitalisms allegedly superior alternative
there can be no doubt that this is what he considered the cornerstone
of a socialist policy and the key to a better and more prosperous
future accordingly socialization of the means of production
has been advocated by all socialists of orthodox marxist persuasion
ever since it is not only what the communist parties of the west officially
have in store for us though they become increasingly reluctant
to say so in order to seize power in all of the western socialist
and socialdemocratic parties a more or less numerous outspoken
and eloquent minority of some influence also exists which arduously
supports such a scheme and proposes socialization if not of
all means of production then at least of those of big industry and
big business most importantly smaller or bigger sectors of nationalized
industries have become part of social reality even in the socalled
most capitalist countries and of course an almost complete
socialization of the means of production has been tried out in the
soviet union and later in all of the sovietdominated countries of
eastern europe as well as in a number of other countries all over
the world the following analysis should thus enable us to understand
the economic and social problems of societies insofar as
they are characterized by nationalized means of production and
in particular it should help us to understand the central problems
that plague russia and its satellites as these countries have carried
a policy of socialization so far that it can justly be said to be their
dominant structural feature it is because of this fact that the type of
socialism under investigation is called russian style
 on marxism and its development  l kolakowski main currents of marxism
 vols oxford  w leonhard sovietideologie die politischen lehren frankfurtm
 when one speaks of socialism russian style it is evident that one abstracts from
the multitude of concrete data which characterize any social system and with respect 
hanshermann hoppe 
as regards the motivational forces pushing socialization
schemes they are avowedly egalitarian once you allow private
property in the means of production you allow differences if i
own resource a then you do not own it and our relationship to
this resource is thus different by abolishing private ownership
everyones position vis a vis means of production is equalized
with one stroke or so it seems everyone becomes coowner of
everything reflecting everyones equal standing as human beings
and the economic rationale of such a scheme is that it is supposedly
more efficient to the untrained observer unfamiliar with the
actioncoordinating function of prices capitalism as based on private
ownership of means of production simply appears chaotic it
seems to be a wasteful system characterized by duplicating efforts
ruinous competition and the absence of concerted coordinated
action as marxists call it depreciatively it is an anarchy of production
only when collective ownership is substituted for private
does it seemingly become possible to eliminate this waste by implementing
a single comprehensive coordinated production plan
to which societies may differ russian style socialism is what has been termed by m
weber an ideal type it is arrived at through the onesided intensification of one or
several aspects and through integration into an immanently consistent conceptual
representation of a multiplicity of scattered and discrete individual phenomena m
weber gesammelte aufsaetze zur wissenschaftslehre tuebingen  p but
to stress the abstract character of the concept by no means implies any deficiency
in it on the contrary it is the very purpose of constructing ideal types to bring out
those features which the acting individuals themselves regard as constituting relevant
resemblances or differences in meaning and to disregard those which they
themselves consider to be of little or no importance in understanding either ones
own or another persons actions more specifically describing russian style socialism
on the level of abstraction chosen here and developing a typology of various forms of
socialism later on should be understood as the attempt to reconstruct those conceptual
distinctions which people use to attach themselves ideologically to various political
parties or social movements hence enabling an understanding of the ideological
forces that in fact shape presentday societies on ideal types as prerequisites for historicosociologic
 a theory of socialism and capitalism
more important though than motivation and promises is
what a socialization of means of production really amounts to
the property rules that are adopted under a socialization policy
and which constitute the basic legal principles of countries like russia
are characterized by two complementary features first nobody
owns the socialized means of production they are socially owned
which is to say precisely no person or no group of persons or all
taken together is allowed to either acquire them or sell them and
keep the receipts from their sale privately their use is determined
by people not in the role of an owner but of a caretaker of things
and secondly no person or group of persons or all taken together
is allowed to engage newly in private investment and create new
private means of production they can neither invest by transforming
the existing nonproductively used resources into productive
ones by original saving by pooling resources with other people
nor by a mixture of these techniques investment can only be done
by caretakers of things never for private profit always on behalf of
the community of caretakers with whom the possible profits from
investments would have to be shared
what does it mean to have such a caretaker economy what
in particular does it imply to change from an economy built on the
natural theory of property to a socialized one in passing two observations
should be made which will already throw some light on
the abovementioned socialist promises of equality and efficiency
declaring everybody a coowner of everything solves the problem
of differences in ownership only nominally it does not solve the
real underlying problem differences in the power to control in an
economy based on private ownership the owner determines what
should be done with the means of production in a socialized economy
this can no longer happen as there is no such owner nonetheless
the problem of determining what should be done with the
 for the following  in particular l v mises socialism indianapolis  of course this complete outlawing of private investment as stated under  only
applies strictly to a fully socialized economy if next to a socialized part of the economy
a private part also exists then private investment would only become curtailed
and hampered to the degree to which the economy is socialized 
hanshermann hoppe 
means of production still exists and must be solved somehow provided
there is no prestabilized and presynchronized harmony of
interests among all of the people in which case no problems whatsoever
would exist anymore but rather some degree of disagreement
only one view as to what should be done can in fact prevail and others
must mutatis mutandis be excluded but then again there must
be inequalities between people someones or some groups opinion
must win over that of others the difference between a private property
economy and a socialized one is only how whose will prevails in
cases of disagreement is to be determined in capitalism there must
be somebody who controls and others who do not and hence real
differences among people exist but the issue of whose opinion prevails
is resolved by original appropriation and contract in socialism
too real differences between controllers and noncontrollers must
of necessity exist only in the case of socialism the position of those
whose opinion wins is not determined by previous usership or contract
but by political means this difference is certainly a highly
important one and our discussion will return to it later in this chapter
and again in later chapters but here it suffices to say thatcontrary
to socialisms egalitarian promisesit is not a difference between a
nonegalitarian and an egalitarian system as regards power of control

in the last chapter i analyzed the orthodox marxist version
of socialismsocialism russianstyle as it was calledand
explained its effects on the process of production and the social
moral structure i went on to point out that the theoretically
foreseen consequences of relative impoverishment proved to be so
powerful that in fact a policy of socializing the means of production
could never actually be carried through to its logical end the
socialization of all production factors without causing an immediate
economic disaster indeed sooner or later all actual realizations
of marxist socialism have had to reintroduce elements of private
ownership in the means of production in order to overcome or
prevent manifest bankruptcy even moderate market socialism
however cannot prevent a relative impoverishment of the population
if the idea of socialized production is not abandoned entirely
once and for all
much more so than any theoretical argument it has been
the disappointing experience with russiantype socialism which
has led to a constant decline in the popularity of orthodox marxist
socialism and has spurred the emergence and development of
modern socialdemocratic socialism which will be the concern
of this chapter both types of socialism to be sure derive from
 a theory of socialism and capitalism
the same ideological sources both are egalitarian in motivation
at least in theory and both have essentially the same ultimate
goal the abolishment of capitalism as a social system based
on private ownership and the establishment of a new society characterized
by brotherly solidarity and the eradication of scarcity a
society in which everyone is paid according to his needs from
the very beginnings of the socialist movement in the midnineteenth
century though there have been conflicting ideas on the
methods best suited for achieving these goals while generally
there was agreement on the necessity of socializing the means of
production there were always diverging opinions on how to proceed
on the one hand within the socialist movement there were
the advocates of a revolutionary course of action they propagated
the violent overthrow of the existing governments the complete
expropriation of all capitalists in one stroke and the temporary
ie until scarcity would indeed as promised be eradicated dictatorship
of the proletariat ie of those who were not capitalists but
who had to sell their labor services in order to stabilize the new
order on the other hand there were the reformists who advocated
a gradualist approach they reasoned that with the enlargement of
the franchise and ultimately with a system of universal suffrage
socialisms victory could be attained through democratic parliamentary
action this would be so because capitalism according to
common socialist doctrine would bring about a tendency towards
the proletarization of society ie a tendency for fewer people to
be selfemployed and more to become employees instead and in
accordance with common socialist beliefs this tendency would in
turn produce an increasingly uniform proletarian class consciousness
which then would lead to a swelling voter turnout for the
socialist party and so they reasoned as this strategy was much
more in line with public opinion more appealing to the mostly
peacefullyminded workers and at the same time less frightening

sovietideologie heute die politischen lehren frankfurtm 
  note  below on the assessment of the somewhat different practice 
hanshermann hoppe 
to the capitalists by adopting it socialisms ultimate success would
only become more assured
both of these forces coexisted within the socialist movement
though their relationship was at times quite strained until
the bolshevik revolution of october  in russia in practice
the socialist movement generally took the reformist path while in
the field of ideological debate the revolutionaries dominated the
russian events changed this with lenin in the lead for the first
time the revolutionary socialists realized their program and the
socialist movement as a whole had to take a stand vis a vis the russian
experiment as a consequence the socialist movement split
into two branches with two separate parties a communist party
either more or less in favor of the russian events and a socialist or
socialdemocratic party with reservations or against them still
the split was not over the issue of socialization both were in favor
of that it was an open split over the issue of revolutionary vs democratic
parliamentary change faced with the actual experience of
the russian revolutionthe violence the bloodshed the practice
of uncontrolled expropriation the fact that thousands of new leaders
very often of questionable reputation or simply shady inferior
characters were being swept to the political helmthe social
democrats in their attempt to gain public support felt they had to
abandon their revolutionary image and become not only in practice
but in theory as well a decidedly reformist democratic party
and even some of the communist parties of the west dedicated
as they were to a theory of revolutionary change but just as much
in need of public support felt they had to find some fault at least
with the peculiar bolshevik way of implementing the revolution
they too increasingly thought it necessary to play the reformist
democratic game if only in practice

however this was only the first step in the transformation
of the socialist movement effected by the experience of the russian
revolution the next step as indicated was forced upon it by
the dim experience with soviet russias economic performance
regardless of their differing views on the desirability of revolutionary
changes and equally unfamiliar with or unable or unwilling to
grasp abstract economic reasoning socialists and communism alike
could still during a sort of honeymoon period which they felt the
new experiment deserved entertain the most illusory hopes about
the economic achievements of a policy of socialization but this
period could not last forever and the facts had to be faced and the
results evaluated after some time had elapsed for every decently
neutral observer of things and later for every alert visitor and traveler
it became evident that socialism russianstyle did not mean
more but rather less wealth and that it was a system above all that
in having to allow even small niches of private capital formation
had in fact already admitted its own economic inferiority if only
implicitly as this experience became more widely known and
in particular when after world war ii the soviet experiment was
repeated in the east european countries producing the very same
dim results and thus disproving the thesis that the soviet mess was
only due to a special asian mentality of the people in their race for
public support the socialist ie the socialdemocratic and communist
parties of the west were forced to modify their programs
further the communism now saw various flaws in the russian
implementation of the socialization program as well and increasingly
toyed with the idea of more decentralized planning and decisionmaking
and of partial socialization ie socialization only
of major firms and industries although they never entirely abandoned
the idea of socialized production the socialist or socialdemocratic
parties on the other hand less sympathetic from the
beginning towards the russian model of socialism and through
their decidedly reformistdemocratic policy already inclined to

accept compromises such as partial socialization had to make a
further adaptive move these parties in response to the russian
and east european experiences increasingly gave up the notion of
socialized production altogether and instead put more and more
emphasis on the idea of income taxation and equalization and in
another move on equalization of opportunity as being the true
cornerstones of socialism
while this shift from russiantype socialism towards a socialdemocratic
one took place and still is taking place in all western
societies it was not equally strong everywhere roughly speaking
and only looking at europe the displacement of the old by
the new kind of socialism has been more pronounced the more
immediate and direct the experience with russiantype socialism
for the population in which the socialist andor communist parties
had to find supporters and voters of all the major countries
in west germany where the contact with this type of socialism is
the most direct where millions of people still have ample opportunities
to see with their own eyes the mischief that has been done
to the people in east germany this displacement was the most
complete here in  the social democrats adopted or rather
were forced by public opinion to adopt a new party program in
which all obvious traces of a marxist past were conspicuously
absent that rather explicitly mentioned the importance of private
ownership and markets that talked about socialization only as a
mere possibility and that instead heavily stressed the importance
of redistributive measures here the protagonists of a policy of
socialization of the means of production within the socialdemocratic
party have been considerably outnumbered ever since and
here the communist parties even when they are only in favor of
peaceful and partial socialization have been reduced to insignificance
in countries further removed from the iron curtain like
france italy spain and also great britain this change has been

 a theory of socialism and capitalism
less dramatic nonetheless it is safe to say that today only socialdemocratic
socialism as represented most typically by the german
socialdemocrats can claim widespread popularity in the west as
a matter of fact due partly to the influence of the socialist internationalthe
association of socialist and socialdemocratic parties
socialdemocratic socialism can now be said to be one of the most
widespread ideologies of our age increasingly shaping the political
programs and actual policies not only of explicitly socialist parties
and to a lesser degree those of the western communism but also of
groups and parties who would not even in their most farfetched
dreams call themselves socialists like the east coast liberal democrats
in the united states and in the field of international politics
the ideas of socialdemocratic socialism in particular of a
redistributive approach towards thesecalled northsouth conflict
have almost become something like the official position among all
wellinformed and wellintentioned men a consensus extending
far beyond those who think of themselves as socialists
what are the central features of socialism socialdemocraticstyle
there are basically two characteristics first in positive
contradistinction to the traditional marxiststyle socialism
socialdemocratic socialism does not outlaw private ownership in
the means of production and it even accepts the idea of all means
of production being privately ownedwith the exception only of
education traffic and communication central banking and the
 indicators for the socialdemocratization of the socialist movement are the rise of
the socialist party and the corresponding decline of the orthodox communist party
in france the emergence of a socialdemocratic party as a rival to the more orthodox
labour party in great britain the moderation of the communism in italy as the only
remaining powerful communist party in western europe toward an increasingly
socialdemocratic policy and the growth of the socialistsocialdemocratic parties
in spain and portugal under gonzales and soares both with close ties to the german
spd furthermore the socialist parties of scandinavia which traditionally had
closely followed the german path and which later provided safe haven to a number
of prominent socialists during the nazi persecution most notably w brandt and b

police and courts in principle everyone has the right to privately
appropriate and own means of production to sell buy or newly
produce them to give them away as a present or to rent them out
to someone else under a contractual arrangement but secondly
no owner of means of production rightfully owns all of the income
that can be derived from the usage of his means of production and
no owner is left to decide how much of the total income from production
to allocate to consumption and investment instead part of
the income from production rightfully belongs to society has to be
handed over to it and is then according to ideas of egalitarianism
or distributive justice redistributed to its individual members furthermore
though the respective incomeshares that go to the producer
and to society might be fixed at any given point in time the
share that rightfully belongs to the producer is in principle flexible
and the determination of its size as well as that of societys share is
not up to the producer but rightfully belongs to society
seen from the point of view of the natural theory of propertythe
theory underlying capitalismthe adoption of these
rules implies that the rights of the natural owner have been aggressively
invaded according to this theory of property it should be
recalled the userowner of the means of production can do whatever
he wants with them and whatever the outcome of his usage it
is his own private income which he can use again as he pleases as
long as he does not change the physical integrity of someone elses
property and exclusively relies on contractual exchanges from the
standpoint of the natural theory of property there are not two separate
processesthe production of income and then after income
is produced its distribution there is only one process in producing
income it is automatically distributed the producer is the
owner as compared with this socialism socialdemocratic style
 note again that this characterization of socialdemocratic socialism has the status
of an ideal type  chapter  n  it is not to be taken as a description of the policy
or ideology of any actual party rather it should be understood as the attempt to
reconstruct what has become the essence of modern socialdemocratic style socialism
underlying a much more diverse reality of programs and policies of various parties
or movements of different names as the ideologically unifying core 
 a theory of socialism and capitalism
advocates the partial expropriation of the natural owner by redistributing
part of the income from production to people who whatever
their merits otherwise definitely did not produce the income
in question and definitely did not have any contractual claims to it
and who in addition have the right to determine unilaterally ie
without having to wait for the affected producers consent how far
this partial expropriation can go
it should be clear from this description that contrary to the
impression which socialism socialdemocratic style is intended to
generate among the public the difference between both types of
socialism is not of a categorical nature rather it is only a matter
of degree certainly the first mentioned rule seems to inaugurate
a fundamental difference in that it allows private ownership but
then the second rule in principle allows the expropriation of all of
the producers income from production and thus reduces his ownership
right to a purely nominal one of course socialdemocratic
socialism does not have to go as far as reducing private ownership
to one in name only and admittedly as the incomeshare that
the producer is forced to hand over to society can in fact be quite
moderate this in practice can make a tremendous difference as
regards economic performance but still it must be realized that
from the standpoint of the nonproducing fellowmen the degree
of expropriation of private producers income is a matter of expediency
which suffices to reduce the difference between both types
of socialismrussian and socialdemocratic styleonce and for
all to a difference only of degree it should be apparent what this
important fact implies for a producer it means that however low
the presently fixed degree of expropriation might be his productive
efforts take place under the everpresent threat that in the
future the incomeshare which must be handed over to society will
be raised unilaterally it does not need much comment to see how
this increases the risk or the cost of producing and hence lowers
the rate of investment
with this statement a first step in the analysis that follows has
already been taken what are the economic in the colloquial sense 
hanshermann hoppe 
of the term consequences of adopting a system of socialdemocratic
socialism after what has just been said it is probably no longer
altogether surprising to hear that at least as regards the general
direction of the effects they are quite similar to those of traditional
marxisttype socialism still to the extent that socialdemocratic
socialism settles for partial expropriation and the redistribution of
producer incomes some of the impoverishment effects that result
from a policy of fully socializing means of production can be circumvented
since these resources can still be bought and sold the
problem most typical of a caretaker economythat no market
prices for means of production exist and hence neither monetary
calculation nor accounting are possible with ensuing misallocations
and the waste of scarce resources in usages that are at best of
only secondary importanceis avoided in addition the problem
of overutilization is at least reduced also since private investment
and capital formation is still possible to the extent that some portion
of income from production is left with the producer to use at
his discretion under socialism socialdemocratic style there is a
relatively higher incentive to work to save and to invest
nonetheless by no means can all impoverishment effects be
avoided socialism socialdemocratic style however good it might
look in comparison with russiantype socialism still necessarily
leads to a reduction in investment and thus in future wealth
as compared with that under capitalism by taking part of the
income from production away from the ownerproducer however
small that part may be and giving it to people who did not produce
the income in question the costs of production which are
never zero as producing appropriating contractings always imply
at least the use of time which could be used otherwise for leisure
consumption or underground work for instance rise and
mutatis mutandis the costs of nonproducing andor underground
production fall however slightly as a consequence there will be
relatively less production and investment even though for reasons
 on the following  l v mises socialism indianapolis  esp part v human
action chicago  esp part  
 a theory of socialism and capitalism
to be discussed shortly the absolute level of production and wealth
might still rise there will be relatively more leisure more consumption
and more moonlighting and hence all in all relative
impoverishment and this tendency will be more pronounced the
higher the income from production that is redistributed and the
more imminent the likelihood that it will be raised in the future by
unilateral noncontractual societal decision
for a long time by far the most popular idea for implementing
the general policy goal of socialdemocratic socialism was to
redistribute monetary in come by means of income taxation or
a general sales tax levied on producers a look at this particular
technique shall further clarify our point and avoid some frequently
encountered misunderstandings and misconceptions about the
general effect of relative impoverishment what is the economic
effect of introducing income or sales taxation where there has
been none before or of raising an existing level of taxation to a
new height in answering this i will further ignore the complications
that result from the different possible ways of redistributing
tax money to different individuals or groups of individualsthese
shall be discussed later in this chapter here we will only take into
account the general fact true by definition for all redistributive systems
that any redistribution of tax money is a transfer from monetary
income producers and contractual money recipients to people
in their capacity as nonproducers and nonrecipients of contractual
money incomes introducing or raising taxation thus implies that
monetary income flowing from production is reduced for the producer
and increased for people in their roles as nonproducers and
noncontractors this changes the relative costs of production for
monetary return versus nonproduction and production for nonmonetary
returns accordingly insofar as this change is perceived
by people they will increasingly resort to leisurely consumption
andor production for the purpose of barter simultaneously reducing
their productive efforts undertaken for monetary rewards in
any case the output of goods to be purchased with money will
  m n rothbard power and market kansas city  
hanshermann hoppe 
fall which is to say the purchasing power of money decreases and
hence the general standard of living will decline
against this reasoning it is sometimes argued that it has been
frequently observed empirically that a rise in the level of taxation
was actually accompanied by a rise not a fall in the gross national
product gnp and that the above reasoning however plausible
must thus be considered empirically invalid this alleged counterargument
exhibits a simple misunderstanding a confusion between
absolute and relative reduction in the above analysis the conclusion
is reached that the effect of higher taxes is a relative reduction
in production for monetary returns a reduction that is as compared
with the level of production that would have been attained
had the degree of taxation not been altered it does not say or imply
anything with respect to the absolute level of output produced as a
matter of fact absolute growth of gnp is not only compatible with
our analysis but can be seen as a perfectly normal phenomenon
to the extent that advances in productivity are possible and actually
take place if it has become possible through improvement in
the technology of production to produce a higher output with an
identical input in terms of costs or a physically identical output
with a reduced input then the coincidence of increased taxation
and increased output is anything but surprising but to be sure
this does not at all affect the validity of what has been stated about
relative impoverishment resulting from taxation 

-----
in the two preceding chapters the forms of socialism most
commonly known and identified as such and that are indeed
derived from basically the same ideological sources were discussed
socialism russianstyle as most conspicuously represented
by the communist countries of the east bloc and
socialdemocratic socialism with its most typical representatives in
the socialist and socialdemocratic parties of western europe and
to a lesser extent in the liberals of the united states the property
rules underlying their policy schemes were analyzed and the idea
presented that one can apply the property principles of russian or
socialdemocratic socialism in varying degrees one can socialize all
means of production or just a few and one can tax away and redistribute
almost all income and almost all types of income or one
can do this with just a small portion of only a few types of income
but as was demonstrated by theoretical means and less stringently
through some illustrative empirical evidence as long as one adheres
to these principles at all and does not once and for all abandon the
notion of ownership rights belonging to nonproducers nonusers
and noncontractors relative impoverishment must be the result
this chapter will show that the same is true of conservatism
because it too is a form of socialism conservatism also produces
impoverishment and all the more so the more resolutely it is
applied but before going into a systematic and detailed economic
 a theory of socialism and capitalism
analysis of the peculiar ways in which conservatism produces this
effect it would be appropriate to take a short look at history in
order to better understand why conservatism indeed is socialism
and how it is related to the two egalitarian forms of socialism discussed
previously
roughly speaking before the eighteenth century in europe
and throughout the world a social system of feudalism or absolutism
which was in fact feudalism on a grander scale existed
in abstract terms the social order of feudalism was characterized
by a regional overlord who claimed ownership of some territory
including all of its resources and goods and quite often also of all
of the men placed upon it without having originally appropriated
them himself through use or work and without having a contractual
claim to them on the contrary the territory or better the
various parts of it and the goods standing on it had been actively
occupied used and produced by different people before the natural
owners the ownership claims of the feudal lords were thus
derived from thin air hence the practice based on these alleged
ownership rights of renting land and other production factors out
to the natural owners in return for goods and services unilaterally
fixed by the overlord had to be enforced against the will of these
natural owners by brutal force and armed violence with the help
of a noble caste of military men who were rewarded by the overlord
for their services by being allowed to participate and share in
his exploitative methods and proceeds for the common man subject
to this order life meant tyranny exploitation economic stagnation
poverty starvation and despair
as might be expected there was resistance to this system

was not the peasant population who suffered most from the existing
order but the merchants and traders who became the leading
opponents of the feudal system buying at a lower price in one place
and traveling and selling at a higher price in a different place as
they did made their subordination to any one feudal lord relatively
weak they were essentially a class of international men crossing
the borders of various feudal territories constantly as such in order
to do business they required a stable internationally valid legal system
a system of rules valid regardless of time and place defining
property and contract which would facilitate the evolution of the
institutions of credit banking and insurance essential to any largescale
trading business naturally this caused friction between the
merchants and the feudal lords as representatives of various arbitrary
regional legal systems the merchants became feudalisms
outcasts permanently threatened and harassed by the noble military
caste attempting to bring them under their control
in order to escape this threat the merchants were forced
to organize themselves and help establish small fortified trading
places at the very fringes of the centers of feudal power as
places of partial exterritoriality and at least partial freedom they
soon attracted growing numbers of the peasantry running away
from feudal exploitation and economic misery and they grew into
small towns fostering the development of crafts and productive
enterprises which could not have emerged in the surroundings of
exploitation and legal instability characteristic of the feudal order
itself this process was more pronounced where the feudal powers
were relatively weak and where power was dispersed among a
great number of often very minor rival feudal lords it was in the
cities of northern italy the cities of the hanseatic league and those
of flanders that the spirit of capitalism first blossomed and commerce
and production reached their highest levels

 it is worth stressing that contrary to what various nationalist historians have
taught the revival of trade and industry was caused by the weakness of central states
by the essentially anarchistic character of the feudal system this insight has been 
 a theory of socialism and capitalism
but this partial emancipation from the restrictions and the
stagnation of feudalism was only temporary and was followed by
reaction and decline this was due in part to internal weaknesses
in the movement of the new merchant class itself still too much
ingrained in the minds of men was the feudal way of thinking in
terms of different ranks assigned to people of subordination and
power and of order having to be imposed upon men through
coercion hence in the newly emerging commercial centers a new
set of noncontractual regulations and restrictionsnow of bourgeois
originwas soon established guilds that restrained free
competition were formed and a new merchant oligarchy arose
more important though for this reactionary process was yet
another fact in their endeavor to free themselves from the exploitative
interventions of the various feudal lords the merchants had
to look for natural allies understandably enough they found such
allies among those from the class of feudal lords who though comparatively
more powerful than their noble fellows had the centers
of their power at a relatively greater distance from the commercial
towns seeking assistance in aligning themselves with the merchant
class they sought to extend their power beyond its present range

at the expense of other minor lords in order to achieve this goal
they first granted certain exemptions from the normal obligations
falling upon the subjects of feudal rule to the rising urban
centers thus assuring their existence as places of partial freedom
and offered protection from the neighboring feudal powers but as
soon as the coalition had succeeded in its joint attempt to weaken
the local lords and the merchant towns foreign feudal ally had
thereby become established as a real power outside of its own traditional
territory it moved ahead and established itself as a feudal
super power ie as a monarchy with a king who superimposed his
own exploitative rules onto those of the already existing feudal system
absolutism had been born and as this was nothing but feudalism
on a larger scale economic decline again set in the towns
disintegrated and stagnation and misery returned
it was not until the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries
then that feudalism came under truly heavy attack this
time the attack was more severe because it was no longer simply
the attempt of practical menthe merchantsto secure spheres
of relative freedom in order to do their practical business it was
increasingly an ideological battle fought against feudalism intellectual
reflection on the causes of the rise and decline of commerce
and industry that had been experienced and a more intensive study
of roman and in particular of natural law which had both been
rediscovered in the course of the merchants struggle to develop
an international merchant law and justify it against the competing
claims of feudal law had led to a sounder understanding of
the concept of liberty and of liberty as a prerequisite to economic

 as these ideas culminating in such works as j lockes
two treatises on government  and a smiths wealth of

circle of people the old order lost its legitimacy the old way of
thinking in terms of feudal bonds gradually gave way to the idea of

england the american revolution of  and the french revolution

revolutions had occurred they proved once and for all that the
old order was not invincible and they sparked new hope for further
progress on the road toward freedom and prosperity
liberalism as the ideological movement that had brought
about these earthshattering events came to be called emerged
from these revolutions stronger than ever and became for somewhat
more than half a century the dominating ideological force
in western europe it was the party of freedom and of private
property acquired through occupation and contract assigning to
the state merely the role of enforcer of these natural rules with
remnants of the feudal system still in effect everywhere however
shaken in their ideological foundation it was the party representing
an increasingly liberalized deregulated contractualized society
internally and externally ie regarding domestic as well as foreign
affairs and relations and as under the pressure of liberal ideas the
european societies became increasingly free of feudal restrictions
it also became the party of the industrial revolution which was
caused and stimulated by this very process of liberalization economic
development set in at a pace never before experienced by
mankind industry and commerce flourished and capital formation
and accumulation reached new heights while the standard
of living did not rise immediately for everyone it became possible

to support a growing number of peoplepeople that is who only
a few years before under feudalism would have died of starvation
because of the lack of economic wealth and who could now survive
in addition with population growth leveling off below the
growth rate of capital now everyone could realistically entertain
the hope of rising living standards being just around the corner
it is against this background of history somewhat streamlined
of course as it has just been presented that the phenomenon
of conservatism as a form of socialism and its relation to the
two versions of socialism originating in marxism must be seen and
understood all forms of socialism are ideological responses to the
challenge posed by the advance of liberalism but their stand taken
against liberalism and feudalismthe old order that liberalism had
helped to destroydiffers considerably the advance of liberalism
had stimulated social change at a pace to an extent and in variations
unheard of before the liberalization of society meant that
increasingly only those people could keep a given social position
once acquired who could do so by producing most efficiently for
the most urgent wants of voluntary consumers with as little cost
as possible and by relying exclusively on contractual relationships
with respect to the hiring of factors of production and in particular
of labor empires upheld solely by force were crumbling under
this pressure and as consumer demand to which the production
structure now increasingly had to adapt and not vice versa was
changing constantly and the upspring of new enterprises became
increasingly less regulated insofar as it was the result of original
appropriation andor contract no ones relative position in
the hierarchy of income and wealth was secure anymore instead
upward and downward social mobility increased significantly for
neither particular factorowners nor owners of particular labor
services were any longer immune to respective changes in demand

 a theory of socialism and capitalism
old marxist and new socialdemocratic socialism are the
egalitarian progressive answers to this challenge of change uncertainty
and mobility like liberalism they hail the destruction of
feudalism and the advance of capitalism they realize that it was
capitalism that freed people from exploitative feudal bonds and
produced enormous improvements in the economy and they
understand that capitalism and the development of the productive
forces brought about by it was a necessary and positive evolutionary
step on the way toward socialism socialism as they conceive
it shares the same goals with liberalism freedom and prosperity
but socialism supposedly improves on the achievements of
liberalism by supplanting capitalismthe anarchy of production
of private competitors which causes the justmentioned change
mobility uncertainty and unrest in the social fabricat its highest
stage of development by a rationally planned and coordinated
economy which prevents insecurities derived from this change
from being felt at an individual level unfortunately of course
as the last two chapters have sufficiently demonstrated this is a
rather confused idea it is precisely by making individuals insensitive
to change through redistributional measures that the incentive
to adapt quickly to any future change is taken away and hence
the value in terms of consumer evaluations of the output produced
will fall and it is precisely because one plan is substituted
for many seemingly uncoordinated ones that individual freedom
is reduced and mutatis mutandis government by one man over
another increased
conservatism on the other hand is the antiegalitarian reactionary
answer to the dynamic changes set in motion by a liberalized
society it is antiliberal and rather than recognizing the
achievements of liberalism tends to idealize and glorify the old
system of feudalism as orderly and stable as a postrevolutionary
in spite of their generally progressive attitude the socialist left is not entirely free
of such conservative glorifications of the feudal past either in their contempt for the
alienation of the producer from his product which of course is the normal consequence
of any market system based on division of labor they have frequently pre
hanshermann hoppe 
phenomenon it does not necessarily and outrightly advocate a
return to the prerevolutionary status quo ante and accepts certain
changes however regretfully as irreversible but it is hardly
ruffled when old feudal powers that had lost all or parts of their
estates to the natural owners in the course of the liberalization process
are restored to their old position and it definitely and openly
propagates the conservation of the status quo ie the given highly
unequal distribution of property wealth and income its idea is to
stop or slow down the permanent changes and mobility processes
brought about by liberalism and capitalism as completely as possible
and instead to recreate an orderly and stable social system in
which everyone remains securely in the position that the past had
assigned to him
in order to do so conservatism must and indeed does advocate
the legitimacy of noncontractual means in the acquisition
and retention of property and income derived from it since it
was precisely the exclusive reliance on contractual relations that
caused the very permanence of changes in the relative distribution
of income and wealth just as feudalism allowed the acquisition
and upholding of property and wealth by force so conservatism
ignores whether or not people have acquired or retain their given
incomeand wealthposition through original appropriation and
contract instead conservatism deems it appropriate and legitimate
for a class of onceestablished owners to have the right to stop any
social change that it considers a threat to their relative position in
the social hierarchy of income and wealth even if the various individual
ownerusers of various production factors did not contract
into any such agreement conservatism then must be addressed
as the ideological heir of feudalism and as feudalism must be
described as aristocratic socialism which should be clear enough

least because of the appeal that the different versions of socialism
with their various promises of security and stability had and still
have for the publics widespread distaste for dynamic change and
mobility liberalisms decline set in socialism increasingly supplanted
it as a dominating ideological force thereby reversing
the process of liberalization and once again imposing more and
more noncontractual elements on society at different times and
places different types of socialism found support in public opinion
to varying degrees so that today traces of all of them can be
found to coexist in different degrees everywhere and to compound
their respective impoverishment effects on the process of production
the upkeep of wealth and the formation of character 

-----

in light of the theoretical arguments presented in the preceding
chapters it appears that there is no economic justification
for socialism socialism promised to bring more economic
prosperity to the people than capitalism and much of its
popularity is based on this promise the arguments brought forward
though have proved that the opposite is true it has been
shown that russiantype socialism characterized by nationalized
or socialized means of production necessarily involves economic
waste since no prices for factors of production would exist because
means of production would not be allowed to be bought or sold
and hence no costaccounting which is the means for directing
scarce resources with alternative uses into the most valueproductive
lines of production could be accomplished and as regards
socialdemocratic and conservative socialism it has been demonstrated
that in any event both imply a rise in the costs of production
and mutatis mutandis a decline in the costs of its alternative
ie nonproduction or blackmarket production and so would
lead to a relative reduction in the production of wealth since both
 a theory of socialism and capitalism
versions of socialism establish an incentive structure that compared
to a capitalist system relatively favors nonproducers and
noncontractors over producers and contractors of goods products
and services
experience too supports this by and large living standards
in the east european countries are significantly lower than in western
europe where the degree to which the socialization of means of
production that has taken place though certainly remarkable is relatively
much lower also wherever one extends the degree of redistributive
measures and the proportion of produced wealth that is
redistributed is increased as for instance in west germany during
the s under socialdemocratic liberal government coalitions
there is a retardation in the social production of wealth or even an
absolute reduction in the general standard of living and wherever
a society wants to preserve the status quo that is a given income
and wealth distribution by means of price controls regulations
and behavioral controlsas for instance in hitlers germany or
presentday italy and francethe living standards will constantly
fall further behind those of more liberal capitalist societies
nonetheless socialism is very much alive and well even in the
west where socialdemocratic socialism and conservatism have
remained powerful ideologies how could this come about one
important factor is that its adherents abandoned the original idea
of socialisms economic superiority and instead resorted to a completely
different argument that socialism might not be economically
superior but is morally preferable this claim will be considered in
chapter  but that is certainly not the end of the story socialism
has even regained strength in the field of economics this became
possible because socialism combined its forces with the ideology
of empiricism which traditionally has been strong in the anglosaxon
world and which in particular through the influence of the
socalled viennacircle of positivist philosophers became the dominant
philosophyepistemologymethodology of the twentieth century
not only in the field of the natural sciences but also in the social
sciences and economics this applies not only to the philosophers
hanshermann hoppe 
and methodologists of these sciences who incidentally have since
freed themselves from the spell of empiricism and positivism but
probably even more so to the practitioners who are still very much
under its influence combining its force with empiricism or positivism
which includes for our purposes the socalled critical rationalism
of k r popper and his followers socialism developed into
what will henceforth be called the socialism of social engineering
it is a form of socialism very different in its style of reasoning from
traditional marxism which was much more rationalistic and deductiveone
that marx had adopted from the classical economist d
ricardo the most important source for marxs own economic writings
but it seems to be precisely because of this difference in style
that the socialism of socialengineering has been able to win more
and more support from the traditional camps of socialdemocratic
and conservative socialists in west germany for instance the ideology
of piecemeal social engineering as k r popper has called
his social philosophy has now become something like the common
ground of moderates in all political parties and only doctrinaires
so it seems of either side do not subscribe to it the former
spdchancellor helmut schmidt even publicly endorsed popperianism
as his own philosophy however it is in the united states
that this philosophy is probably more deeply rooted as it is almost

 a theory of socialism and capitalism
how could empiricismpositivism help save socialism on a
highly abstract level the answer should be clear empiricismpositivism
must be able to provide reasons why all the arguments given
so far have failed to be decisive it must try to prove how one can
avoid drawing the conclusions that i have drawn and still claim
to be rational and to operate in accordance with the rules of scientific
inquiry but how in detail can this be accomplished on
this the philosophy of empiricism and positivism offers two seemingly
plausible arguments the first and indeed the most central
of its tenets is this knowledge regarding reality which is called
empirical knowledge must be verifiable or at least falsifiable by
experience and experience is always of such a type that it could
in principle have been other than it actually was so that no one
could ever know in advance ie before actually having had some
particular experience if the outcome would be one way or another
if mutatis mutandis knowledge is not verifiable or falsifiable by
experience then it is not knowledge about anything realempirical
knowledge that isbut simply knowledge about words about
the use of terms about signs and transformational rules for them
or analytical knowledge and it is highly doubtful that analytical
knowledge should be ranked as knowledge at all
if one assumes this position as i will do for the moment it
is not difficult to see how the above arguments could be severely
rebuffed the arguments regarding the impossibility of economic
calculation and the costraising character of socialdemocratic or
conservative measures necessarily leading to a decline in the production
of goods and services and hence to reduced standards of
living evidently claimed to be valid a priori ie not falsifiable by
any kind of experience but rather known to be true prior to any
later experiences now if this were indeed true then according
to the first and central tenet of empiricismpositivism this argument
could not contain any information about reality but instead
would have to be considered idle verbal quibblingan exercise in
 on the following  m hollis and e nell rational economic man cambridge
 ppff 
hanshermann hoppe 
tautological transformations of words such as cost production
output of production consumptionwhich do not say anything
about reality hence empiricism concludes that insofar as reality
ie the real consequences of real socialism is concerned the arguments
presented thus far carry no weight whatsoever rather in
order to say anything convincing about socialism experience and
experience alone would have to be the decisive thing to consider
if this were indeed true as i will still assume it would at once
dispose of all of the economic arguments against socialism which i
have presented as being of a categorical nature there simply could
not be anything categorical about reality but even then wouldnt
empiricismpositivism still have to face up to the real experiences
with real socialism and wouldnt the result of this be just as decisive
in the preceding chapters much more emphasis was placed
on logical principle categorical all used synonymously here reasons
directed against socialisms claims of offering a more promising
way to economic prosperity than through capitalism and
experience was cited only loosely in order to illustrate a thesis
whose validity could ultimately have been known independent
of illustrative experience nonetheless wouldnt even the somewhat
unsystematically cited experience be sufficient to make a case
against socialism
the answer to these questions is a decisive no the second
tenet of empiricismpositivism explains why it formulates the
extension or rather the application of the first tenet to the problem
of causality and causal ex planation or prediction to causally
explain or predict a real phenomenon is to formulate a statement
of either the type if a then b or should the variables allow quantitative
measurement if an increase or decrease of a then an
increase or decrease of b as a statement referring to reality with
a and b being real phenomena its validity can never be established
with certainty ie by examination of the proposition alone
or of any other proposition from which the one in question could
in turn be logically deduced but will always be and remain hypothetical
depending on the outcome of future experiences which 
 a theory of socialism and capitalism
cannot be known in advance should experience confirm a hypothetical
causal explanation ie should one observe an instance
where b indeed followed a as predicted this would not prove that
the hypothesis is true since a and b are general abstract terms
universals as opposed to proper names which refer to events
or processes of which there are or at least might in principle be
an indefinite number of instances and hence later experiences
could still possibly falsify it and if an experience falsified a hypothesis
ie if one observed an instance of a that was not followed by
b this would not be decisive either as it would still be possible
that the hypothetically related phenomena were indeed causally
linked and that some other previously neglected and uncontrolled
circumstance variable had simply prevented the hypothesized
relationship from being actually observed a falsification would
only prove that the particular hypothesis under investigation was
not completely correct as it stood but rather needed some refinement
ie some specification of additional variables which one
would have to watch out for and control in order to be able to
observe the hypothesized relationship between a and b but to be
sure a falsification would never prove once and for all that a relationship
between some given phenomena did not exist
given that this empiricistpositivist position on causal explanation
is correct it is easy to see how socialism could be rescued
from empirically justified criticism of course a socialistempiricist
would not deny the facts he would not argue that there indeed
is a lower standard of living in eastern than in western europe
and that increased taxation or a conservative policy of regulations
and controls have indeed been found to correlate with a retardation
or shrinking in the production of economic wealth but within the
boundaries of his methodology he could perfectly well deny that
based on such experiences a principled case against socialism and
its claim of offering a more promising path toward prosperity could
be formulated he could that is to say play down the seemingly
falsifying experiences and any other that might be cited as merely
accidental as experiences that had been produced by some unfortunately
neglected and uncontrolled circumstances which would 
hanshermann hoppe 
disappear and indeed turn into its very opposite revealing the true
relationship between socialism and an increased production of
social wealth as soon as these circumstances had been controlled
even the striking differences in the standard of living between east
and west germanythe example that i stressed so heavily because
it most closely resembles that of a controlled social experiment
could thus be explained away in arguing for instance that the
higher living standards in the west must be explained not by its
more capitalist mode of production but by the fact that marshall
aid had streamed into west germany while east germany had to
pay reparations to the soviet union or by the fact that from the
very beginning east germany encompassed germanys less developed
rural agricultural provinces and so had never had the same
starting point or that in the eastern provinces the tradition of serfdom
had been discarded much later than in the western ones and
so the mentality of the people was indeed different in both east
and west germany etc
in fact whatever empirical evidence one brings forward
against socialism as soon as one adopts the empiricistpositivist
philosophy ie as soon as the idea of formulating a principled
case either in favor of or against socialism is dropped as in vain
and illconceived and it is instead only admitted that one can of
course err with respect to the details of some socialist policy plan
but would then be flexible enough to amend certain points in ones
policy whenever the outcome was not satisfactory socialism is
made immune to any decisive criticism because any failure can
always be ascribed to some as yet uncontrolled intervening variable
not even the most perfectly conducted controlled experiment
it should be noted could change this situation a bit it would
never be possible to control all variables that might conceivably
have some influence on the variable to be explainedfor the practical
reason that this would involve controlling literally all of the
universe and for the theoretical reason that no one at any point in
time could possibly know what all the variables are which make up
this universe this is a question whose answer must permanently
remain open to newly discovered and discerned experiences 
 a theory of socialism and capitalism
hence the above characterized immunization strategy would work
without exception and unfailingly and since as we know from the
writings of the empiricists themselves and in particular those of d
hume there exists no band that one could observe to connect
visibly certain variables as causes and effects it should be noted
that there would be no way whatsoever to exclude any variable as a
possible disturbing influence from the outset without indeed trying
it out and controlling it not even the seemingly most absurd and
ridiculous variables such as for instance differences in weather
or a fly passing by in one case but not in the other could be ruled
out in advance all that could be done would be to point to experience
again flies passing or not passing by never made a difference
for the outcome of an experiment but according to the
empiricist doctrine itself this experience referring as it does only
to past instances would once again not help decide the matter
definitively and a reference to it would only amount to a begging
of the question 

-----

the last four chapters have provided systematic reasons and
empirical evidence for the thesis that socialism as a social
system that is not thoroughly based on the natural theory
of property the firstusefirstown rule which characterizes
capitalism must necessarily be and in fact is an inferior system
with respect to the production of wealth and the average standard
of living this may satisfy the person who believes that economic
wealth and living standards are the most important criteria in
judging a societyand there can be no doubt that for many ones
standard of living is a matter of utmost importanceand because
of this it is certainly necessary to keep all of the above economic
reasoning in mind yet there are people who do not attach much
importance to economic wealth and who rank other values even
higherhappily one might say for socialism because it can thus
quietly forget its original claim of being able to bring more prosperity
to mankind and instead resort to the altogether different
but even more inspiring claim that whereas socialism might not be
the key to prosperity it would mean justice fairness and morality
all terms used synonymously here and it can argue that a tradeoff
between efficiency and justice an exchange of less wealth for
 a theory of socialism and capitalism
more justice is justified since justice and fairness are fundamentally
more valuable than economic wealth
this claim will be examined in some detail in this chapter in
so doing two separate but related claims will be analyzed  the
claim made in particular by socialists of the marxist and the socialdemocratic
camp and to a lesser degree also by the conservatives
that a principled case in favor of socialism can be made because of
the moral value of its principles and mutatis mutandis that capitalism
cannot be defended morally and  the claim of empiricist
socialism that normative statements should or ought statementssince
they neither solely relate to facts nor simply state
a verbal definition and thus are neither empirical nor analytical
statementsare not really statements at all at least not statements
that one could call cognitive in the widest of all senses but rather
mere verbal expressions used to express or arouse feelings such
as wow or grrrrr
the second empiricist or as its position applied to the field
of morals is called emotivist claim will be dealt with first as in a
way it is more farreaching the emotivist position is derived by
accepting the central empiricistpositivist claim that the dichotomous
distinction between empirical and analytical statements is of
an allinclusive nature that is that any statement whatsoever must
be empirical or analytical and never can be both this position it
will be seen turns out to be selfdefeating on closer inspection just
as empiricism in general turned out to be selfdefeating if emotivism
is a valid position then its basic proposition regarding normative
statements must itself be analytical or empirical or else it must
be an expression of emotions if it is taken to be analytical then it is
mere verbal quibble saying nothing about anything real but rather
 for such a position  a j ayer language truth and logic new york

idea that reason is and can be no more than the slave of the passions is to be found
in d hume treatise on human nature ed selbybigge oxford 
  also chapter  above
hanshermann hoppe 
only defining one sound by another and emotivism would thus be
a void doctrine if instead it is empirical then the doctrine would
not carry any weight as its central proposition could well be wrong
in any case right or wrong it would only be a proposition stating
a historical fact ie how certain expressions have been used in the
past which in itself would not provide any reason whatsoever why
this would have to be the case in the future too and hence why one
should or rather should not look for normative statements that are
more than expressions of emotions in that they are meant to be justifiable
and the emotivist doctrine would also lose all its weight if
it adopted the third alternative and declared its central tenet itself
a wow statement too for if this were the case then it would not
contain any reason why one should relate to and interpret certain
statements in certain ways and so if ones own instincts or feelings
did not happen to coincide with somebody elses wowing there
would be nothing that could stop one from following ones own
feelings instead just as a normative statement would be no more
than the barking of a dog so the emotivist position then is no more
than a barking comment on barking
on the other hand if the central statement of empiricismemotivism
ie that normative statements have no cognitive meaning
but are simply expressions of feelings is itself regarded as a
meaningful statement communicating that one should conceive of
all statements that are not analytical or empirical as mere expressive
symbols then the emotivist position becomes outrightly contradictory
this position must then assume at least implicitly that
certain insights ie those relating to normative statements cannot
simply be understood and meaningful but can also be given justification
as statements with specific meanings hence one must conclude
that emotivism falters because if it were true then it could
not even say and mean what it saysit simply would not exist as
a position that could be discussed and evaluated with regard to its
validity but if it is a meaningful position which can be discussed
then this fact belies its very own basic premise moreover the fact
that it is indeed such a meaningful position it should be noted
cannot even be disputed as one cannot communicate and argue 
 a theory of socialism and capitalism
that one cannot communicate and argue rather it must be presupposed
of any intellectual position that it is meaningful and can
be argued with regard to its cognitive value simply because it is
presented in a language and communicated to argue otherwise
would already implicitly admit its validity one is forced then to
accept a rationalist approach towards ethics for the very same reason
that one was forced to adopt a rationalist instead of an empiricist
epistemology yet with emotivism so rebuffed i am still
far away or so it seems from my set goal which i share with the
marxist and conservative socialists of demonstrating that a principled
case in favor of or against socialism or capitalism can be made
what i have reached so far is the conclusion that the question of
whether or not normative statements are cognitive ones is itself a
cognitive problem however it still seems to be a far cry from there
to the proof that actual norm proposals can indeed be shown to be
either valid or invalid
fortunately this impression is wrong and there is already
much more won here than might be suspected the above argument
shows us that any truth claimthe claim connected with
any proposition that it is true objective or valid all terms used
synonymously hereis and must be raised and decided upon in
the course of an arg and since it cannot be disputed
that this is so one cannot communicate and argue that one cannot
communicate and argue and it must be assumed that everyone
knows what it means to claim something to be true one
cannot deny this statement without claiming its negation to be

true this has been aptly called the a priori of communication and
args
now arguing never just consists of freefloating propositions
claiming to be true rather args is always an activity too
but given that truth claims are raised and decided upon in argumentation
and that argumentation aside from whatever is said in
its course is a practical affair it follows that intersubjectively meaningful
norms must existprecisely those which make some action
an argumentationwhich have special cognitive status in that they
are the practical preconditions of objectivity and truth
hence one reaches the conclusion that norms must indeed
be assumed to be justifiable as valid it is simply impossible to
argue otherwise because the ability to argue so would in fact presuppose
the validity of those norms which underlie any argumentation

note the structural resemblance of the a priori of argument to the a priori
of action ie the fact as explained in chapter  above that there is no way of disproving
the statement that everyone knows what it means to act since the attempt to
disprove this statement would presuppose ones knowledge of how to perform certain
activities indeed the indisputability of the knowledge of the meaning of validity
claims and action are intimately related on the one hand actions are more fundamental
than argument with whose existence the idea of validity emerges as
argumentation is clearly only a subclass of action on the other hand to say what
has just been said about action and arg and their relation to each other
already requires arg and so in this senseepistemologically that is
ar must be considered to be more fundamental than nonargumentative
action but then as it is epistemology too which reveals the insight that although it
might not be known to be so prior to any argumentation in fact the development of
args presupposes action in that validity claims can only be explicitly discussed
in an argument if the persons doing so already know what it means to have
knowledge implied in actions both the meaning of action in general and args
in particular must be thought of as logically necessary interwoven strands of
a priori knowledge
 methodologically our approach exhibits a close resemblance to what a gewirth
has described as the dialectically necessary method reason and morality chicago 
 a theory of socialism and capitalism
ends can or cannot be justified is to be derived from the concept of
argumentat and with this the peculiar role of reason in determining
the contents of ethics is given a precise description too
in contrast to the role of reason in establishing empirical laws of
nature reason can claim to yield results in determining moral laws
which can be shown to be valid a priori it only makes explicit what
is already implied in the concept of argumentation itself and in
analyzing any actual norm proposal its task is merely confined to
analyzing whether or not it is logically consistent with the very ethics
which the proponent must presuppose as valid insofar as he is
able to make his proposal at all
 pa method of a priori reasoning modeled after the kantian idea of
transcendental deductions unfortunately though in his important study gewirth
chooses the wrong starting point for his analyses he attempts to derive an ethical
system not from the concept of argumentation but from that of action however
this surely cannot work because from the correctly stated fact that in action an agent
must by necessity presuppose the existence of certain values or goods it does not
follow that such goods then are universalizable and should thus be respected by others
as the agents goods by right on the requirement of normative statements to be
universalizable  the following discussion in the text rather the idea of truth or
regarding morals of universalizable rights or goods only emerges with argumentation
as a special subclass of actions but not with action as such as is clearly revealed
by the fact that gewirth too is not engaged simply in action but more specifically
in argumentation when he tries to convince us of the necessary truth of his ethical
system however with argumentation recognized as the one and only appropriate
starting point for the dialectically necessary method a capitalist ie nongewirthian
ethic follows as will be seen on the faultiness of gewirths attempt to derive
universalizable rights from the notion of action  also the perceptive remarks by m
macintyre after virtue notre dame  pp j habermas moralbewusstsein
und kommunikatives handeln frankfurtm  pp and h veatch
human rights baton rouge  pp 
 the relationship between our approach and a natural rights approach can now
be described in some detail too the natural law or natural rights tradition of philosophic
thought holds that universally valid norms can be discerned by means of reason
as grounded in the very nature of man it has been a common quarrel with this
position even on the part of sympathetic readers that the concept of human nature
is far too diffuse and varied to provide a determinate set of contents of natural law
a gewirth law action and morality in georgetown symposium on ethics
essays in honor of h veatch ed r porreco new york  p furthermore
its description of rationality is equally ambiguous in that it does not seem to distinguish
between the role of reason in establishing empirical laws of nature on the one
hand and normative laws of human conduct on the other  for instance the discussion
in h veatch human rights baton rouge  p 
hanshermann hoppe 
but what is the ethics implied in argumentation whose validity
cannot be disputed as disputing it would implicitly have to presuppose
it quite commonly it has been observed that argumentation
implies that a proposition claims universal acceptability or should
it be a norm proposal that it is universalizable applied to norm
proposals this is the idea as formulated in the golden rule of ethics
or in the kantian categorical imperative that only those norms
can be justified that can be formulated as general principles which
are valid for everyone without exception indeed as argumentation
implies that everyone who can understand an argument must
in principle be able to be convinced of it simply because of its argumentative
force the universalization principle of ethics can now
be understood and explained as grounded in the wider a priori
of communication and argumentation yet the universalization
principle only provides a purely formal criterion for morality to
be sure checked against this criterion all proposals for valid norms
which would specify different rules for different classes of people
could be shown to have no legitimate claim of being universally
acceptable as fair norms unless the distinction between different
classes of people were such that it implied no discrimination
but could instead be accepted as founded in the nature of things
again by everyone but while some norms might not pass the test
in recognizing the narrower concept of argumentation instead of the wider one
of human nature as the necessary starting point in deriving an ethic and in assigning
to moral reasoning the status of a priori reasoning clearly to be distinguished
from the role of reason performed in empirical research our approach not only
claims to avoid these difficulties from the outset but claims thereby to be at once
more straightforward and rigorous still to thus dissociate myself from the natural
rights tradition is not to say that i could not agree with its critical assessment of most
of contemporary ethical theory indeed i do agree with h veatchs complementary
refutation of all desire teleological utilitarian ethics as well as all duty deontological
ethics see human rights baton rouge  chapter  nor do i claim
that it is impossible to interpret my approach as falling in a rightly conceived natural
rights tradition after all what i claim though is that the following approach is
clearly out of line with what the natural rights approach has actually come to be and
that it owes nothing to this tradition as it stands
 the universalization principle figures prominently indeed among all cognitivist
approaches to morals for the classical exposition  i kant grundlegung zur
metaphysik der sitten and kritik der praktischen vernunft in kant werke ed
weischedel vol iv wiesbaden  
 a theory of socialism and capitalism
of universalization if enough attention were paid to their formulation
the most ridiculous norms and what is of course even more
relevant even openly incompatible norms could easily and equally
well pass it for example everybody must get drunk on sundays or
be fined or anyone who drinks alcohol will be punished are both
rules that do not allow discrimination among groups of people and
thus could both claim to satisfy the condition of universalization
clearly then the universalization principle alone would not
provide one with any positive set of norms that could be demonstrated
to be justified however there are other positive norms
implied in argument aside from the universalization principle
in order to recognize them it is only necessary to call three interrelated
facts to attention first that argument is not only a cognitive
but also a practical affair second that argument as a
form of action implies the use of the scarce resource of ones body
and third that argument is a conflictfree way of interacting
not in the sense that there is always agreement on the things
said but in the sense that as long as argument is in progress
it is always possible to agree at least on the fact that there is disagreement
about the validity of what has been said and this is to
say nothing else than that a mutual recognition of each persons
exclusive control over his own body must be presupposed as long
as there is arguments note again that it is impossible to deny
this and claim this denial to be true without implicitly having to
admit its truth
